AUTHOR BIOGRAPHIES
Christian Rosenkjaer Andersen works in the business of con-
sultant engineering with HVAC systems. He lives near Aarhus in 
Denmark with his patient wife, silly cat, and fantastic little boy 
— to all of whom his work is dedicated. He is well into his second 
decade of gaming, but new to the world of writing.
Evangeline Cheng is new to writing in the world of Ars Mag-
ica. She dedicates this book to her partner in crime, Mark, who 
also does double duty as her husband and ideas bounce-board. 
She may be bribed with chocolate and red handbags. 
Camo Coffey plays far too many games and occasionally pre-
tends to work. He is a player in Mark Shirley’s ongoing Northum-
brian saga. Since encountering Camo, Mark no longer attempts 
to predict how his players will behave. Since encountering his 
botch dice, neither does Camo. His magus, Hygwald Veritas, suf-
fers from the Major Supernatural Flaw, Played By Camo; and he 
deserves everything he gets.
Mark Faulkner is a chef at Excalibur nightclub in Chicago. 
He has been gaming since he was in grade school, and has been 
an avid Ars Magica fan for several editions now. His other hob-
bies include studying history, comic books, and learning how 
to DJ.
Timothy Ferguson is an Australian librarian. He’d like to ded-
icate this book to his wife, Linda.
A natural-born grog, Mark “which draft are we on” Lawford 
found an afﬁnity with many of the grogs he contributed to this 
book. But he’s happy to let those who know him best decide 
which ones. He still lives in Eastbourne, where his keyboard is 
under constant threat from Asparagus and Dexter, two conniving 
cats sent by their faerie master to disrupt his life’s work.
Mark Shirley (“Not that Mark, the other Mark”) is a grog 
who has specialized in Profession: Biomathematician, much 
to the detriment of his Philosophiae (zoology) Ability; but he 
is really working on his Craft: Ars Magica Sourcebooks. This 
book is in honor of all the vanguards he has seen buried over 
the years.
Ars Magica players participate in a thriving fan community by subscribing to email discussion lists (like the Berke-
ley list), compiling archives of game material (such as Project Redcap), maintaining fan-created web sites, and running

Introduction
Chapter One
Welcome to Grogs! In this book 
you will ﬁnd a wealth of information 
and character ideas to bring life to 
that most overlooked and underused 
of characters — the grog. The ﬁrst 
half of the book is devoted to telling 
stories about grogs, whether they are 
at the covenant, adventuring alone, 
or involved in stories with magi and 
companion characters. There is also a 
chapter devoted to the quick creation 
and maintenance of grog characters so 
that a troupe can support a fair num-
ber without being burdened with their 
upkeep. The second half of the book 
consists of a large number of charac-
ter concepts to bring life to your turb. 
Each is presented with a number of 
character options, including at least 
one new General or Supernatural Flaw 
to make grog characters more inter-
esting. Every character concept has 
a handful of story ideas, including at 
least one explaining why such a grog 
might join up with a covenant.
What is  
a Grog?
Equating “grog” with “soldier” is 
an easy habit to fall into, since the 
principle use of a covenant’s non-ma-
gus inhabitants is to defend the magi 
against mundane threats. However, 
grogs can be any kind of minor char-
acter that has a support role: crafts-
men, scholars, and so forth. This 
book presents a large number of ideas 
and archetypes that address all variet-
ies of grogs.
The Term “Grog”
There are various origin stories for 
the term “grog,” which seems to be a 
word coined by the Order of Hermes. 
The most commonly held opinion is 
that it has its origins at Arae Flaviae, 
the ﬁrst multi-House covenant. At 
this covenant, the men and women 
who accompanied the magi when 
they journeyed from home were 
called viri gregis (meaning “men of the 
band,” singular vir gregis). This became 
corrupted, so the story goes, by a 
hard-of-hearing captain and the non-
Latin speaking covenfolk into “grog.” 
The term was spread around the Or-
der through the liber gregis (see insert). 
Other terms entered the Hermetic 
vernacular at the same time: turb, cus-
tos, and consors.
TURB
The turb is a term used to refer to 
the ﬁghting force of a covenant, the 
sum total of its warriors. Some put 
the origin of the word with the same 
captain that gave the Order “grog,” 
who shortened the Latin contubernium 
(meaning a squad of eight legionaries 
who shared a tent and cooking ﬁre). 
The word has become conﬂated with 
turba, meaning “mob;” and this has be-
come the word most commonly used 
in the modern Order of Hermes to de-
scribe its soldiers. 
The Liber Gregis
The liber gregis is a collection of 
the wisdom of Beorhtric of Saxony, 
the grog captain at Arae Flaviae. 
When it became apparent that the 
doughty Beorhtric was getting on 
in years, the magi assigned a scribe 
to follow him around and make a 
record of his wisdom, in prepara-
tion for the day that he would 
need to be replaced. These notes 
were then compiled into a book by 
an unnamed scribe. How much of 
the book is actually derived from 
Beorhtric and how much was add-
ed by the scribe is unknown. The 
book had no formal title, but it 
became known as the liber gregis as 
copies of it were made and wide-
ly circulated within the Order of 
Hermes.
Some of Beorhtric’s wisdom can 
be found in the following pages. If 
you wish to include a copy of the 
book in a covenant’s library, it can 
be considered to be a tractatus on 
Leadership of Quality 9.

Grogs
GREX
The word grex (plural greges), mean-
ing “troop” or “company” (whence vir 
gregis is derived) is occasionally used 
in a contemptuous manner by magi, 
since it also means “herd” or “ﬂock.” 
Nevertheless, it is still used to describe 
the group of grogs that accompany 
magi on expeditions; it thereby has 
a meaning similar to unit or squad. A 
grex typically numbers up to six indi-
viduals, and a turb might be composed 
of several greges as permanent units 
who work well together, or each grex 
might be assembled anew, according 
to the demands of the task ahead of it.
CUSTOS
A custos (“watchman” or “keeper,” 
plural custodes) is a favored grog, usu-
ally one with skills that set him apart 
from his fellows, but a custos can also 
distinguish himself with great deeds or 
uncommon displays of loyalty. Custo-
des are often set apart from the rest of 
the covenfolk and awarded the privi-
leges of a higher social rank, such as 
a better provision of food and wine, a 
few pence more each month in wages, 
or other minor beneﬁts. In some cove-
nants, grogs can be raised to the rank of 
custos at the whim of the magi, while 
others have a formal procedure for pro-
motions. Custodes are usually equated 
to specialists when building a covenant 
(ArM5, page 71) and determining its 
ﬁnances (Covenants, page 63).
COVENFOLK
The servants, specialists, and sol-
diers who live in a Hermetic covenant; 
generally synonymous with “grogs.” 
The singular forms of “covenman” and 
“covenmaid” are rarely used.
CONSORS
A consors (plural consortes) is liter-
ally a companion to the magi. From 
the very earliest days of the Order, 
magi have associated themselves with 
mundanes who have similar inter-
ests or background, or complemen-
tary skills. A consors is a Companion 
character, and beyond the scope of 
this book.
AUTOCRAT
The autocrat is a mundane whom 
some covenants appoint to over-
see the smooth running of the cov-
enant. He or she is usually the most 
important of all the covenfolk, bar 
the magi themselves; the covenant 
of Arae Flaviae even permitted their 
autocrat to attend meetings of the 
wizards’ council.

“No-one is to be kept in your household 
if you have not reasonable belief that they are 
faithful, discreet, painstaking and honest, and 
of good manners ... if they are disloyal, unwise, 
ﬁlthy in person, unproﬁtable, gluttonous, quar-
relsome, or drunken, they should be turned out.”
 
 
 — Robert Grosseteste, Rules
The majority of grogs in service to 
magi live and work at the covenant, and 
spend most of their lives within its walls. 
This chapter discusses the life of a grog 
at a covenant: what their roles are and 
how they are organized and governed.
Types of Grogs
The inhabitants of a covenant 
— excluding magi and companions 
— can be split into three broad cate-
gories. First are the servants, who con-
tribute to the day-to-day operation of 
the covenant; next are the specialists, 
who are concerned with the personal 
demands of the magi; and ﬁnally the 
soldiers, who assist in its defense.
Servants
A covenant’s servants are those es-
sential personnel who keep the cove-
nant running. Much of the time, they 
go about their labors unremarked by 
the magi, but without them, meals 
would not be cooked, chambers 
would not be cleaned, and crops 
would go unharvested in the ﬁelds. 
The in-house servants are the cooks, 
bakers, maids, stablehands, errand 
boys, and so forth. Craftsmen also 
belong to the servant class: stone-
masons and carpenters maintain the 
physical structure of the covenant; 
blacksmiths, weavers, leatherworkers, 
and chandlers contribute to the con-
sumables; armorers, weapon smiths 
and bowyers create and maintain the 
equipment of the soldiers; and glass-
blowers, potters, parchment-makers, 
and binders support the laboratories 
and scriptoria of the magi.
In addition to the indoor servants, 
there are the outdoor servants: the 
farmhands, ﬁshermen, hunters, and 
herders who provide food for the cov-
enant; and the teamsters who procure 
and transport provisions and supplies.
In the Covenants supplement for 
Ars Magica Fifth Edition, the number 
of servants and teamsters required by 
a covenant is determined by the to-
tal number of inhabitants of the cov-
enant (Covenants, page 64). Broadly 
speaking, in a Spring covenant, two 
servants and one teamster are needed 
to support two magi, three compan-
ions, or ten soldiers. Laborers and 
craftsmen are not essential, but with-
out them, the covenant has to buy all 
its food and supplies. Laborers can re-
duce expenditure on Provisions, and 
craftsmen can reduce expenditure on 
a wide range of covenant costs (Cov-
enants, page 66).
PERSONAL SERVANTS
Many covenants assign a personal 
servant to every magus. Each magus 
may have preferences for the type of 
food he is served, when and how his 
sanctum is cleaned, how his clothes

Chapter Two
Story Seed: Understairs Rivalry
The serving folk have grown sick 
of the airs and graces put on by the 
personal servant of one of the magi, 
and feel she needs to be brought 
down a peg or two. They plot to 
cause her to look incompetent and 
foolish in front of her master by 
sabotaging her efforts. This might 
begin as simple teasing, but could 
easily progress into something dan-
gerous without meaning to. For ex-
ample, the serving folk might switch 
the contents of two containers, not 
realizing what effect this will have 
on the magus’s lab work. This might 
force a roll on the Experimentation 
Table, and if the season of work is 
wasted or ruined, the magus will 
want to know why.
The player characters could be 
the targeted servant and her friends, 
the saboteurs, or the characters try-
ing to resolve the situation, such as 
the chamberlain and the turb captain.

Grogs
are tailored, and so forth. Further-
more, this servant eventually grows 
used to her master’s Gift (see Chapter 
4). Some personal servants become 
specialists of some kind, or even 
laboratory assistants if they have suf-
ﬁcient intelligence. Other magi pre-
fer their personal servants to be their 
agents outside of the covenant. Of 
course, the extreme example of such 
a servant is a companion character, 
although most magi have a personal 
servant as well as a companion. On 
the other hand, there are some magi 
who barely register the presence of a 
personal servant.
Despite having many similarities 
to specialists or even soldiers (see 
later), a personal servant is still very 
much responsible for day-to-day tasks 
around the magus’s sanctum. He en-
sures that his meals are provided on 
time, and are to his liking, perhaps 
even preparing them himself. He lays 
out his clothes for each day, sees to 
mending any rips and tears, and assists 
in his bathing routine. He may assist 
in shaving, cutting hair, and trimming 
nails, and understands the importance 
of destroying any remnants in sight 
of his master. He has a daily routine 
of tidying the living quarters and pos-
sibly the laboratory, and is certainly 
apprised of what he may and may not 
touch, although if the magus has an 
apprentice, the cleaning of the labo-
ratory may be part of the apprentice’s 
duties rather than the manservant’s. 
Performing all these services for a ma-
gus is the mark of the personal servant; 
if he is exempted from these in lieu of 
other duties, then he is probably a 
specialist rather than a servant.
Being the personal servant of a ma-
gus holds a certain cachet in the “un-
derstairs” hierarchy of the covenant, 
and personal servants form a privileged 
elite among the covenfolk. This might 
qualify them for the Custos Virtue, or 
the improved status might be more 
subtle than this. The personal servant 
might hint at — or possess in reality — 
the ear of his master, and use this to se-
cure better food or quarters for himself. 
He typically aggrandizes his master 
among the covenfolk (even if secretly 
he terriﬁes him), and the fortunes of a 
personal servant track the status of the 
magus within the covenant.
Personal servants make good grogs 
to play. Unlike companion characters, 
a personal servant can easily be run by 
the player of the magus he serves, but 
it is often more fun if a different player 
is involved to assist with the dialogue 
between the two. The Abilities of a 
personal servant should complement 
those of his magus; some concepts are 
given here:

THE CHAMBERLAIN
The chamberlain coordinates the 
activities of all the servants in a cov-
enant. Every covenant has a chamber-
lain of sorts (although the position is 
not always ofﬁcially recognized); with-
out one, the day-to-day running of all 
but the smallest covenant would grind 
to a halt. In small covenants, a charac-
ter can take on the role of chamber-
lain while performing other tasks for 
the covenant, but most medium-sized 
covenants require a dedicated per-
son in this role. Large covenants may 
grant the chamberlain a personal staff 
of ofﬁcials: one in charge of the food, 
another in control of the clothing, an-
other overseeing the craftsmen, and so 
forth (see “A Noble Household,” later). 
Governing the servants of a covenant 
is covered by the Profession: Chamber-
lain Ability, and chamberlains are usu-
ally treated as specialists.
Although it is not absolutely nec-
essary, most chamberlains can read 
and write and know basic arithmetic 
(all covered by the Artes Liberales 
Ability); this permits them to keep 
the covenant accounts, and a schedule 
for planning the harvests and other 
seasonal events, and to learn from the 
covenant rolls (see insert).
A conscientious chamberlain can 
improve the overall attitude of the 
servants in the face of The Gift, by 
acting as an intermediary between the 
magi and the servants. The chamber-
lain mediates the effects of The Gift 
The Covenant Rolls
The covenant rolls are the re-
cords of the accounts from previous 
years, and are an invaluable aid to 
the chamberlain. He can consult 
the rolls of previous years to plan 
ahead for the coming season, and if 
they are of sufﬁcient age, the rolls 
allow him to make predictions for 
the harvest. 
The rolls serve as a summa for 
the Profession: Chamberlain Ability, 
typically with a Quality of 6. The 
Level starts at 2, but increases by 1 
for every two decades of the cov-
enant’s existence. A character could, 
in theory, learn the whole job of a 
chamberlain from reading the rolls 
of an old covenant. The rolls are 
also usually a tractatus of Area Lore: 
Covenant, of Quality 6. However, if 
chamberlains have made a habit of 
using the rolls as a diary, these trac-
tatus build into an encyclopedia of 
Area Lore: Covenant. Every decade, 
a new volume is added to the en-
cyclopedia, and every ﬁve volumes 
comprise a new tractatus of Quality 
6 (for more on encyclopedias, see Art 
& Academe, page 27). A chamberlain 
cannot learn from the material he has 
personally contributed to the cov-
enant rolls, so gets no beneﬁt from 
any level increases during his tenure. 
If removed from the covenant, 
the rolls constitute an Arcane Con-
nection to the covenant lasting 
weeks (ArM5, page 84), and even 
when the connection has expired, 
they are a sympathetic connection 
to the covenant with a bonus to the 
Penetration Multiplier of +1. Like 
other encyclopedias, the rolls can be 
used to look up speciﬁc facts about 
the covenant: make an Intelligence 
+ Area Lore: Covenant roll with an 
Ease Factor related to the obscurity 
of the information sought. The char-
acter need not have the Area Lore: 
Covenant Ability to make a research 
attempt, and receives a +1 bonus per 
tractatus in the rolls.
Of course, not all covenants 
have an unbroken series of rolls, and 
not all past chamberlains may have 
contributed material of equal value. 
There may be a gap where a cham-
berlain was not able to read or write, 
or scribed her records in a different 
language or in a cipher. Furthermore, 
some of the rolls of parchment may 
have become lost, damaged, or sto-
len. The storyguide should deter-
mine the effects that this has on the 
Level and Quality of the rolls; in 
general, rolls missing volumes have a 
lower Level, whereas damaged rolls 
have a lower Quality. 
The rolls may also contain long-
lost secrets about the covenant, as 
chamberlains occasionally use the 
rolls as a personal diary as well as an 
accounts book. They are of potential 
interest to an enemy, since the rolls 
might have all sorts of details about 
the covenant that could be exploit-
ed, such as a record of the building 
of secret passages, locations of vis 
sources, and special requirements 
of the magi. It is quite possible that 
the magi are totally unaware of the 
existence of the covenant rolls, and 
may be horriﬁed at the level of detail 
innocently added by chamberlains 
over the years.
STORY SEED:  
UNDERCOVER ACCOUNTS
The covenant rolls go miss-
ing, and the chamberlain places the 
player characters in charge of ﬁnd-
ing them again. This must be done 
without the magi discovering what 
they are doing, since the rolls con-
tain all sorts of embarrassing obser-
vations about the magi made by the 
former (or current) chamberlain, 
and perhaps even secrets about the 
covenant itself. The location of the 
missing rolls could be innocent (the 
parchment-maker has scraped them 
clean, not realizing their impor-
tance) or potentially damaging (an 
enemy agent has taken them).

and boosts the Prevailing Loyalty of 
the covenfolk (Covenants, page 38, and 
Chapter 4 of this book). However, the 
chamberlain could just as easily poison 
the minds of his staff against the magi, 
and can reduce the Prevailing Loyalty 
instead of increasing it. Magi are usu-
ally careful to choose a trustworthy 
individual as their chamberlain, and to 
keep him happy.
The chamberlain often has to con-
tend with the personal servants of the 
magi, who seek to reserve particular 
resources or services for their masters 
that are needed elsewhere. These per-
sonal servants often treat the chamber-
lain as an equal rather than a superior, 
and in some covenants this is explic-
itly permitted. This is a very good way 
to alienate the chamberlain.
Specialists
The specialists are those covenfolk 
who do not contribute to the day-to-
day running of the covenant, or to its 
defense. It is a catch-all category that 
covers a wide range of skills, from mun-
dane professions such as scout, hunts-
man, and merchant; through skilled 
professions such as scribe, trainer, and 
translator; to exotic professions such 
as animal trainer, alchemist, and bard. 
Specialists are generally quite focused 
on a few key Abilities, and are retained 
by the covenant because they are good 
at their jobs. Individuals who are good 
all-rounders, or skilled in multiple ar-
eas of expertise, are usually companion 
characters. Because of the enhanced 
capacities they offer a covenant above 
and beyond its normal business, spe-
cialists are bought with covenant build 
points (ArM5, page 72).
Craftsmen often straddle the line 
between servants and specialists with 
respect to how they ﬁt into the cov-
enant’s hierarchy. A smith who works 
for the covenant is considered a servant 
if his daily labor is to make tools for the 
covenant, sharpen agricultural tools, 
and repair broken metal items. How-
ever, if he makes unique items for the 
magi, or crafts ﬁne goods for sale, then 
he is classed as a specialist. Both are 
“craftsmen” according to Covenants, and 
may reduce the outgoings of the cov-
enant, but the master craftsman claims 
the privileges of a specialist, whereas 
the more menial workers are paid and 
fed as servants. For example, a specialist 
craftsmen is an artisan, a master of his 
craft, and is in charge of a workshop in 
which his journeymen and apprentices 
are the covenant’s servants.
Many of the personal servants of 
the magi (see earlier) would also fall 
into the specialist role, if they did 
not apply their talents speciﬁcally in 
the service of a single magus. Nev-
ertheless, a personal servant might 
command the same salary, food, and 
accommodation privileges as a spe-
cialist, and cost the same in terms of 
covenant ﬁnances (Covenants, page 63).
AGENTS
Agents are specialists who, rather 
than working within the covenant itself 
or in its immediate vicinity, are to be 
found further aﬁeld. An agent could be 
as simple as a merchant or craftsman 
maintaining a business in a nearby city. 
However, most agents have been care-
fully placed to maximize their use to the 
covenant, as sources of information or 
remote assistance. A cautious covenant 
might have agents in the local bishop’s 
palace, among the staff of an important 
nobleman, or even in a rival covenant. 
The steward (see later) is usually re-
sponsible for coordinating the agency 
of a covenant, although covenants with 
large agencies often employ a factor to 
manage their agents. The factor is usu-
ally placed under the direct command 
of the steward.
Agents still need to be bought 
with covenant build points like any 
other specialist, but they need not be 
included in the covenfolk roster when 
it comes to determining ﬁnances. 
Their salary is subsumed into the gen-
eral budget of the covenant, unless the 
covenant maintains an unusual num-
ber of agents. Rules for recruiting and 
using agents are to be found in Houses 
of Hermes: Societates, pages 140–144.
THE STEWARD
The steward is an appointed ofﬁcer 
of the covenant charged with seeing to 
the needs of the specialists. This role 
differs from that of the chamberlain 
in that the steward is not normally in 
charge of the specialists, but he is ul-
timately responsible for ensuring that 
The Autocrat
Arae Flaviae combined the posi-
tion of chamberlain and steward into 
a single role, called the autocrat. 
Many covenants since have followed 
their example. The role of autocrat 
is an important one; he is in com-
mand of all the non-military coven-
folk, and is therefore perhaps the 
most inﬂuential member of the cov-
enant who is not a magus. Autocrats 
are occasionally permitted to attend 
meetings of the covenant’s council, 
and asked to provide reports. Some 
autocrats are even allowed to com-
ment on matters brought before 
the council, although if the matter 
is inconsequential to the covenant’s 
structure or inhabitants, their opin-
ions might be ignored.
The liber gregis has a lot to say 
about the role of the autocrat, all 
of it positive. Rather than being 
Beorhtric’s words, these sections are 
generally believed to derive from 
interpolations by the scribe, who re-
ported directly to the autocrat.

Grogs
they perform the job for which they 
are employed. The steward therefore 
makes sure that an artisan has the raw 
materials that he needs, that the animal 
trainer has sufﬁcient cages, and that 
the forester has arrows made for him 
by the covenant’s ﬂetcher. He also ar-
ranges purchasers for the goods made 
by specialist craftsmen. In most cov-
enants, the role of steward is not sub-
ordinate to the specialists (although 
he himself may be treated as one); 
he must marshal the resources of the 
specialists so that they provide the ser-
vices demanded by the magi, and he is 
responsible for discipline. The role of 
steward is governed by the Profession: 
Steward Ability, and they often have 
the Leadership Ability in addition.
A good steward ameliorates the 
effects that The Gift has on the cov-
enant’s specialists by ensuring that the 
magi are aware of the contributions of 
their skilled covenfolk, and suggesting 
Troop Types
Those who perform military ser-
vice, either as conscripts or as volun-
teers, are usually trained so that they 
can serve in certain military units, 
rather than given an overall educa-
tion in many different weapons and 
Martial Abilities. The most common 
troop types in Mythic Europe are de-
scribed in this insert.
INFANTRY
Archers: The English longbowman 
is a comparatively new troop 
type and still used principally in 
a defensive conﬁguration. Archer 
units armed with short bows are 
occasionally used in warfare, but 
the short bow is considered prin-
cipally a hunting weapon. The 
Saracens have employed archer 
units since the ﬁrst Crusades, and 
Western armies are beginning to 
copy them.
Crossbowmen: Lacking the accu-
racy and shooting rate of the 
longbow, but more powerful and 
requiring less training, crossbow-
men are deployed with javelin-
ers and archers, and also used to 
protect the command staff. The 
Genoese crossbowmen are fa-
mous as mercenaries throughout 
Mythic Europe. Rules for cross-
bows can be found in Covenants 
and Lords of Men.
Heavy Infantry: The basic foot-sol-
dier, clad in the heaviest armor 
that can be afforded — usually 
metal scale — and armed with 
long swords or maces, and round 
shields. The heavy infantry usu-
ally composes the greater part of 
an army; cavalry units can only 
be overcome with weight of 
numbers or with missile ﬁre.
Javeliners: Where longbows are not 
employed, the javelin is the prin-
ciple missile unit. Javeliners are 
occasionally skirmish units, but 
are usually combined with stan-
dard infantry.
Mounted Infantry: These are units 
that ride to battle and then dis-
mount to ﬁght; this tactic does 
not risk valuable horses, and 
lends superior mobility to the 
otherwise 
slow-maneuvering 
heavy infantry.
Pikemen: These troops employ the 
long spear in a “hedgehog” for-
mation of densely-packed men. 
These troops are commonly ur-
ban militia or peasant levies, but 
the Scots, the Flemish, the Swabi-
ans, and the Bavarians specialize 
in this unit type. The length of 
the weapon prevents men-at-arms 
from engaging, and can effective-
ly break up a cavalry charge.
Skirmishers: Light infantry armed 
with 
javelins, 
slings, 
short 
swords, or spears, and some-
times light shields. Skirmisher 
units are lightly armored to pro-
vide battleﬁeld mobility, and are 
usually used to harry the enemy 
from the ﬂanks or defend the 
heavy infantry.
CAVALRY
Heavy Cavalry: The preeminent 
military force in the 13th cen-
tury, knights are employed as 
shock troops at the beginning of 
combat. Lances are used for the 
initial charge, and the knights 
then switch to long swords, 
maces, 
or 
mace-and-chain. 
Chain mail is almost ubiqui-
tous. Further from the heartland 
of Mythic Europe, conscripted 
heavy cavalry troops are em-
ployed in the Byzantine armies 
(the famed kataphractoi), and by 
the Bulgarians, Lithuanians, and 
Russians.
Light Cavalry: Deployed principal-
ly in scouting, communication, 
and reconnaissance roles, and to 
join battle with enemy recon-
naissance units. Light cavalry 
use swift horses and light armor, 
and usually carry spears or long 
swords. Occasionally, they carry 
missile weapons.
Lancers: More lightly armored than 
the heavy cavalry, yet armed with 
long spears and used to support 
infantry in the absence of other 
cavalry units.
Mounted Archers: Employed in Ro-
man times but since then have 
lost favor; however, mounted ar-
chers are common in the east of 
Mythic Europe.

occasional rewards or singling out par-
ticular individuals for praise (Covenants, 
page 38). Much like the chamberlain, 
a poorly-treated or overworked stew-
ard may have the reverse effect, caus-
ing the covenfolk’s reaction to The 
Gift be heightened, and encourage 
disloyalty and rebellion.
Rivalry between the steward and 
the chamberlain is quite common. 
Some covenants explicitly place the 
chamberlain as a specialist under the 
command of the steward, whereas oth-
ers make them equals. Both branches 
of the covenant’s covenfolk perform 
important functions, but each branch 
chief elevates the importance of his 
staff over that of the other branch. 
This rivalry can seethe beneath the 
surface for many generations of coven-
folk, while the magi remain blissfully 
ignorant of it, since it rarely impinges 
on their sphere of interest. The “Orga-
nization” section later in this chapter 
presents some ideas as to how such 
rivalries can generate stories. Many 
covenants avoid this potential rivalry 
through an autocrat who plays both 
roles (see insert).
Soldiers
The soldiers are those grogs 
whose duty is to defend the cov-
enant and its members from physical 
threats. Combat-capable companions 
are rarely considered to be soldiers; 
they are more likely to act as heroes 
and champions than as common foot-
soldiers. Furthermore, soldiers need 
to train together and have roughly 
equal Combat Totals to ﬁght effec-
tively as a trained group; companion 
characters are either too busy to at-
tend drill practice or too skilled (or 
both) to take part. It is unusual for 
a covenant to have no soldiers — 
Mythic Europe is a sufﬁciently dan-
gerous place that even the most paci-
ﬁstic magi need protection.
Due to the restrictions of the Code 
of Hermes, magi are not permitted to 
provide feudal service to local lords in 
terms of manpower; and yet it cannot 
have escaped the attention of the local 
nobility that the “scholars” on the hill 
have a standing army. They might in-
terpret this as a threat or an opportuni-
ty to fulﬁll their own feudal obligations 
to their liege without risking their own 
men in a war. Indeed, some covenants 
may even hire out their soldiers to the 
nobility as a source of income. Every 
saga needs to consider the attitude of 
the mundane powers toward magi em-
ploying soldiers; some ideas for this in-
teraction can be found in Lords of Men.
THE TURB CAPTAIN
The turb captain is the leader of 
all the soldiers at a covenant. Only 
covenants with very unusual organi-
zation structures do not have a single 
leader for all their warriors, since an 
army cannot be effectively lead by 
a committee. Of the three executive 
ofﬁcers of a covenant (chamberlain, 
steward, and captain), the turb cap-
tain is the most likely to be a com-
panion character. Even though the 
captain may be too skilled with his 
weapon to ﬁght in a trained group 
with his men, his leadership and 
tactical knowledge are invaluable. A 
turb captain is provisioned as a spe-
cialist at least, and may be treated as 
a companion character even if he is 
designed as a grog, in recognition of 
his importance to the covenant.
UNIT SERGEANTS
The captain often selects sergeants 
to command smaller units of the turb. 
This is particularly important if the 
soldiers consist of specialized troops, 
such as cavalry, archers, or infantry. 
In these cases, one sergeant is placed 


--- Page ---

14
Grogs
in charge of each unit of troops. Ser-
geants are usually selected based on 
their demonstrated loyalty and dedi-
cation to the covenant, in addition to 
having the Leadership Ability. Ser-
geants are rewarded by being treated 
as specialists with respect to wages, 
food, and accommodation.
THE DRILL SERGEANT
In addition to unit sergeants, most 
covenants also have a drill sergeant, 
whose principal role is to train the 
grogs to ﬁght as a trained group. This 
involves providing a season of teach-
ing in a Martial Ability (usually Single 
Weapon) over the course of each year. 
The drill sergeant is also responsible 
for maintaining order in the turb, and 
administering punishments as war-
ranted. He may be responsible for 
inﬂicting punishment on other coven-
folk, such as servants, specialists, or 
even apprentices. Drill sergeants fol-
low a more regular duty pattern than 
most other soldiers (see “Duty,” later); 
their duty watches are through the 
day when they can train the off-duty 
soldiers. A drill sergeant is only asked 
to be on duty during the night to ﬁll in 
a gap in the schedule.
Most drill sergeants are older 
grogs, those who have substantial ex-
perience in battle. Their prime Abili-
ties other than Martial Abilities are 
Leadership and, particularly, Teach-
ing. Leadership is useful to accelerate 
the group’s training (see insert) and 
to maintain discipline. Drill sergeants 
beneﬁt from good Communication, 
and their Martial Abilities need to be 
higher than those of the soldiers they 
are teaching. Like other sergeants, the 
drill sergeant is accounted as a spe-
cialist, although he remains under the 
command of the turb captain.
OTHER MILITARY RANKS
Medium-sized turbs do not usually 
need any other ranks beyond the cap-
tain and his sergeants, at least with re-
spect to organization. However, cov-
enants often reward their particularly 
loyal or heroic soldiers with an inter-
mediate rank between the common 
soldiers and the sergeants, roughly 
equivalent to corporal. The name used 
varies from covenant to covenant; the 
liber gregis suggests “decurio” or “decu-
rion,” the leader of 10 men in the Ro-
man army. This rank is represented by 
the Custos Social Status Virtue. The 
Custos is usually offered a double ra-
tion of wine or ale each day, and an 
improved pension when he retires 
from the covenant’s service; in addi-
tion, custodes are often promoted to 
sergeant before their military career 
ends. Large turbs usually require a rig-
id hierarchy to maintain discipline; see 
“Military Hierarchy,” later.
Depending on their organization, 
soldiers may retain the temporary 
ranks and roles granted on missions 
(see Chapter 4), although it is more 
usual that these roles are kept ﬂuid, 
and are for expeditions only. Never-
theless, a decurio often fulﬁlls the Op-
tio role, and a sergeant is often chosen 
for the Dux role, making these ranks 
semi-permanent.
Organization of 
Covenant Grogs
The organization of grogs in a 
covenant may have been arranged 
when the covenant was founded and 
reorganized deliberately as the cov-
enant grew in size, or it may have de-
veloped organically over its history. 
This section presents a few concepts 
around which a covenant organization 
can be built. Naturally it is possible to 
mix-and-match; for example, a cov-
enant’s soldiers might be organized in 
a hierarchical fashion, but its servants 
and specialists might be divided into 
nations. The manner in which the 
grogs are organized can be an impor-
Accelerated Group Training
Any group can learn to ﬁght to-
gether by spending a season prac-
ticing together. A good leader can 
shorten this training time, either 
in an emergency (to prepare for 
an upcoming adventure or battle), 
or in order to train more than one 
group in a single season. These 
rules were ﬁrst printed in Lords of 
Men, Chapter 9.
SHORTEN TRAINING TIME:  
Stress die + Communication  
+ Leadership
The Ease Factor depends on the 
amount of training time available. If 
the roll fails, then the group cannot 
become a trained group until the 
end of the season. If it botches, then 
the season’s training is wasted. Some 
Virtues, such as Inspirational, may 
provide a bonus if the storyguide 
sees ﬁt; the Difﬁcult Underlings 
Flaw most likely provides a penalty.

Grogs
tant determiner of the mood and feel 
of a covenant, and the troupe should 
put a bit of thought into which system 
they prefer.
Hierarchy
A hierarchical organization of a 
covenant’s grogs is perhaps the most 
commonly found. It is the least work 
for the magi, as they have a small num-
ber of ofﬁcials reporting to them, who 
then marshal their subordinates to 
complete the tasks at hand. The two 
most signiﬁcant hierarchical models 
adopted are those of the noble house-
hold and the military.
A NOBLE HOUSEHOLD
Covenants who employ a large 
number of servants and specialists 
often adopt an organizational struc-
ture that mimics that of the noble 
household. This is a natural model to 
adopt, since examples of how well it 
functions can be found throughout 
Mythic Europe. However, the level 
of complexity is only really needed if 
the covenant is a large one, or is mas-
querading as a lord of the manor. At its 
most basic level this organization ap-
proximates the norm for covenants — 
perhaps due to the inﬂuence of the liber 
gregis — since the three chief ofﬁcials 
in a noble household are the steward, 
the chamberlain, and the marshal.
The steward (or seneschal) is in 
control of the lord’s lands and the 
keep, and is often a knight. The stew-
ard sometimes has an under-steward 
called the steward of the household, 
or ﬁlls this role himself in smaller 
households. Any miscellaneous spe-
cialists, such as craftsmen employed 
directly by the household, fall under 
the steward’s purview.
• The bailiff is in control of the 
lord’s manors. He has a subordi-
nate reeve in each village, who is 
responsible for the direct oversight 
of the daily work of the villeins.
• The verderer, or forest warden, 
maintains the hunting preserve of 
the household. He is often in con-
trol of the huntsmen.
• The chief buyer is responsible for 
acquiring goods and services need-
ed by the household.
• The auditor keeps the accounts re-
lating to the income of the land.
• The cook is in charge of preparing 
and cooking all food for the house-
hold. Under him are the saucier, 
the baker, the poulterer, and any 
number of other kitchen menials.
• The butler is the wine steward, 
and responsible for supplying the 
household with food. Under him 
are the pantrymen and brewers.
The chamberlain (or treasurer, or 
wardrober) is the chief clerical ofﬁcer, 
and is occasionally a subordinate of 
the steward. The wardrobe is a special 
room where valuables are kept, and 
serves as the noble’s treasury.
• The clerk of the ofﬁces is the 
chamberlain’s deputy, and the 
chief scribe.
• The chaplain is the household’s 
personal priest. His ﬁrst duty is to 
the household’s master, but he oc-
casionally hears confession for the 
servants as well.
• The almoner is responsible for dis-
tributing wealth to the poor, and 
hiring temporary staff.
• The usher is in charge of the mas-
ter’s chamber. Under him are the 
porter, who keeps the keys to the 
household, the servants of the 
chamber, the laundresses, and 
the barber.
The marshal is the leader of the 
household knights or men-at-arms. 
He is also in charge of the horses and 
needs of the stables. In some house-
holds, he is considered subordinate to 
the steward, but in most covenants us-
ing this model, this is not true.
• The mesnie are the household 
knights of the lord, who form his 
bodyguard. These knights are re-
sponsible for training the squires 
and pages.
• The men-at-arms are the lord’s 
personal ﬁghting force, and are the 
equivalent of the turb.
• The smith, farriers, and ostlers care 
for the horses of the household.
• The carters also fall under the 
purview of the marshal, since he 
is responsible for all the house-
hold’s horses.
• Messengers may be hired on at a 
daily rate, or else employed directly.
Underneath these servants with 
named jobs is a great mass of scullions, 
grooms, boy attendants, and helpers.

Story Seed: Tough at the Top
A grog character has recently 
been promoted to a higher rank, 
and he is still ﬁnding his feet. His 
biggest problem is not the new 
responsibilities; but instead his 
friends — now part of his com-
mand — and his rival for the posi-
tion. The latter is eaten with jealou-
sy toward the player character, and 
in a moment of weakness turned to 
a witch to secure his revenge. The 
grog is now under a curse which, 
whether real or imagined, is blamed 
for the misfortune that dogs every 
step he makes. The grog may need 
his friends to help him get the curse 
lifted and expose the malfeasance 
of his rival.

MILITARY HIERARCHY
Rather than dividing the covenfolk 
by role, a covenant can take a more 
military approach. In this organiza-
tional system, the covenfolk are divid-
ed into squads, each of which consists 
of soldiers and their auxiliary staff. 
An army in Mythic Europe is largely 
free of intermediate ranks. The mar-
shal is in charge of his lord’s house-
hold troops, including the knights and 
men-at-arms. If his lord goes to war, 
the marshal takes charge of the men-
at-arms, while the lord commands 
the knights; otherwise, he leads the 
knights himself (in lieu of the tenant-
in-chief, thus the later rank “lieuten-
ant”) and appoints a captain to com-
mand the men-at-arms.
This model is appropriate for mil-
itary-minded covenants, but not nec-
essarily only them. In a similar way 
to dividing covenfolk into nations 
(see later), this structure can ﬁll a role 
where, for example, the covenant is 
divided over several geographically 
separate sites. The difference to the 
system of nations is that, in a military 
hierarchy, each squad is not indepen-
dent of each other.
Exempli gratia: Traditional covenants like 
to follow the early Roman model, where the 
manus (“hand,” singular and plural), com-
prised of a squad of four men plus their leader 
(the quincurion), is the basic unit. A decuria 
is made of two manus, with the leader of one 
manus, the decurion, superior to the other. 
Up to 10 decuriae make up the centuria, 
commanded by a centurion.
Nations
Another method of organizing 
grogs is by nation. A nation of grogs 
consists of servants, specialists, and 
soldiers — possibly even companions 
and magi. The identifying feature of a 
nation is that it cuts across roles. One’s 
nation may be determined by a num-
ber of methods. Sometimes new mem-
bers are assigned at random, either by 
lot or in order to ﬁll gaps in the ranks. 
Otherwise, a recruit might join the 
nation of the person (magus or other-
wise) who inducted him into covenant 
life. Alternatively, the nations them-
selves might decide, holding an auc-
tion or contest whenever new recruits 
join the covenant, perhaps having re-
cruits be members of no nation until 
sufﬁcient numbers of unplaced grogs 
are accrued. Finally, recruits could be 
born to a nation, either as the child of 
a grog, or a member of a speciﬁc eth-
nic group.
Nation-level 
organizations 
are 
common in covenants where magi are 
relatively independent of each other. 
Each nation might be dedicated to the 
service of a single magus, or led by a 
companion instead. Members of na-
tions often have a Loyalty Personality 
Trait speciﬁc to the nation as well as to 
the covenant.
FAMILY GROUPS
The most natural nations form 
around familial bonds. Old covenants, 
in particular, have covenfolk who were 
born in the covenant and have served 
the magi all their lives. These families 
can stretch back generations, each one 
tracing its ancestry back to one of the 
original servants of the covenant, or 
even one of the magi. Alternatively, 
a covenant might, at its foundation, 
have incorporated folk from the lo-
cal area who were already strongly 
divided along family lines. It is usual 
for a woman to join her husband’s fam-
ily when they marry, but this is not al-
ways the case: in Irish clan structures, 
for example, the man may join the 
woman’s family.
Family-based nations usually have 
a clear leader, who is often the eldest 
living member of that family, although 
some have a council of elders, or an 
elected head, or a clear line of succes-
sion. Families often share distinctive 
physical features or character traits, 
and may even inherit particular pat-
terns of warping.
Exempli gratia: When founded, a cov-
enant employed four brothers, who all went on 
to have prodigiously-sized families. Three of 
these families still persist (the fourth has since 
perished), called Rufus, Flavus, and Fuscus, 
since the families tend to be red-headed, blond, 
and brown-haired, respectively.
ETHNIC GROUPS
The student bodies of some uni-
versities in Mythic Europe are divided 
into nations, with each nation respon-
sible for the conduct and protection 
of each of its members (Art & Academe, 
page 94). These nations are usually 
loose geographical groups; the closest 
ethnic groups are well represented, 
Story Seed: Family Business
At the deathbed of a family 
member, the grog characters dis-
cover that their family hides a 
dark secret. One of their ancestors 
pledged his soul to a demon, along 
with one soul from every subse-
quent generation. The player grogs 
are among the eligible members for 
the demon’s appetites, but to secure 
help from the rest of the covenant, 
they must betray the darkest secret 
of their family, condemning them 
to unbearable shame and dishonor. 
And how will the magi react if they 
discover that they have diabolic 
covenfolk?

Grogs
whereas more distant students are 
lumped into much wider categories. 
Some covenants, particularly ones 
that straddle borders or have been 
formed from the merging of two or 
more turbs with distinct racial identi-
ties, use this structure.
Exempli gratia: A covenant on the bor-
der between France and Spain might have 
the nations of Castellan, Occitan, Fran-
cian, and German, based on the native lan-
guage of the members. The German nation 
takes anyone who doesn’t speak Spanish, 
Occitan, or French.
Exempli gratia: A covenant in the Holy 
Land might have been founded as a joint ven-
ture between Hermetic magi and non-Hermetic 
wizards. It therefore has two nations: Oc-
cidens, consisting of the Western covenfolk 
who accompanied the Hermetic magi; and al-
Mashriq, consisting of the Arabic covenfolk 
who serve their eastern masters.
DIVIDED BY LOCATION
Nations may also form where a 
covenant is split over several geo-
graphically separated sites, or has de-
liberate spatial separation of its turb. 
There may be some separation of 
function in these nations; the nation 
that lives offshore probably has more 
sailors and ﬁshermen than the nation 
that occupies the nearby hills, but 
both nations need their own special-
ists, soldiers, and servants.
Exempli gratia: A covenant occupying an 
isolated fort high on a mountain has the na-
tions of Castellum, Moenia, Montes, and Sil-
va. The Castellum grogs live in and defend the 
fort, the Moenia nation guards the outer walls, 
the Montes patrol the tundra above the treeline, 
and the Silva grogs hunt in the woods below 
the treeline. Each nation consists of servants, 
specialists, and soldiers with skills appropriate 
to the habitat in which they dwell.
Exempli gratia: A covenant occupies a 
number of small islands on a lake. None of the 
islands is big enough to support sancta for all 
of the magi, so each island is home to a single 
magus, and the staff he needs form indepen-
dent nations, governed as their master dictates. 
There is also a nation answerable only to the 
council of magi, which provides, supports, and 
protects the ferry service linking the islands.
Guilds
An alternative to nations is guilds; 
that is, organizing the grogs by their 
function. Many covenants simply di-
vide their covenants into servants, 
specialists, and soldiers, and consider 
these three “guilds” sufﬁcient — and 
often they are. However, the larger 
covenants get, the more need there is 
to divide the grogs into smaller guilds 
with more deﬁned functions. A cov-
enant that has more than one source 
of income often institutes guilds as a 
means to organize collecting the rev-
enue and conducting the necessary 
business that keeps the income sourc-
es operational.
There is also a tendency for grogs 
to self-organize. If there are a lot of 
craftsmen, then they tend to band 
together to mimic the guild structure 
of the outer world. If the covenant 
uses light cavalry as an elite unit, then 
these individuals may not want to frat-
ernize with common foot soldiers.
Note that the division of grogs 
into guilds does not necessarily mean 
literal guilds; that is, a political unit 
that can arrange simultaneous with-
drawal of services in order to coerce 
better conditions for their masters. 
However, the Guild Covenant Hook 
(Covenants, page 19) can be bought if 
this situation is desirable.
PROFESSIONAL GUILDS
Clearly a good model for covenant 
organization is the craft guilds, service 
guilds, and merchant guilds that are 
becoming more widespread in Mythic 
Europe in the 13th century. Once con-
ﬁned to big cities, guilds can now be 
found almost anywhere, at least in the 
West, and they regulate the quality 
of the goods produced by their mem-
bers. A guild consists of all craftsmen 
that use the same or a group of closely 
allied Craft or Profession Abilities. 
However, at a covenant, a guild might 
exist for each Martial Ability, or per-
haps even for select groups of Arcane 
or Supernatural Abilities. The guild 
provides incomes for the destitute and 
disabled, pays for the funeral services 
of deceased members, holds its own 
religious ceremonies, and sometimes 
even provides schooling for their 
members’ children.
At the head of a guild is the dean, 
elected by the guild members from 
among their number. The dean is sup-
ported by the aldermen (guild ofﬁ-
cials), who police the guild, ensure the 
quality of the work, and enforce the 
guild rules. Below the aldermen are the 
senior masters and masters. A master 
has sufﬁcient skill to run his own shop, 
and has the right to attend meetings at 
the guildhall and have a say in the run-
Story Seed: Lack of Guild Funds
The leader of a soldiers’ guild is 
either incompetent or corrupt, and 
as a result, the guild has insufﬁcient 
funds to subcontract other coven-
folk for the basic needs of his guild, 
such as repairing clothes and armor. 
The soldiers begin to look shabby, 
and their equipment is of substan-
dard quality. Keen to hide his mis-
takes, the guild leader is open to 
“outside contractors,” and when ap-
proached by a mysterious stranger 
who seems to ask for very little in 
return, he is eager to employ him. 
This stranger could be a faerie, de-
mon, or spy from another covenant 
seeking to worm his way in to the 
covenant.

Grogs
ning of the guild. Senior masters have 
been masters for ten or more years, 
and may run more than one workshop, 
which can prove very lucrative. Each 
master might have one or two journey-
men and several apprentices, who form 
the lowest rungs of the guild ladder. 
More information about guilds can be 
found in Chapter 3 of City & Guild.
The difference between a profes-
sional guild and other forms of gover-
nance is that the guild exists because 
its members want it. They have an 
expectation of advancement through 
the guild’s ranks, and to one day have 
a say in how it is run. A guild might be 
a more familiar system for players who 
are used to concepts of social mobil-
ity and providing beneﬁts for the hard 
workers, although this is an anachro-
nism for much of Mythic Europe out-
side of the professional guilds.
Exempli gratia: A covenant has three 
guilds of soldiers: the Red Lions, the Golden 
Hawks, and the Green Horses. The Red Lions 
provide the infantry, and are also responsible 
for guarding the residences of the magi. The 
Golden Hawks are archers, and man the gate 
and walls of the covenant. The Green Horses 
are a cavalry unit, and maintain all the cov-
enant’s stables, not just their own. These guilds 
are permitted to train their own junior war-
riors, and select their own sergeants and cap-
tains. The covenant grants the captain a lump 
sum each year, which is distributed among the 
soldiers as wages, with some kept in reserve for 
funeral expenses, rewards, and so forth. Each 
captain is in charge of the discipline of its own 
men. Each guild must subcontract the coven-
folk for any services, such as care of the sick 
and injured, or repair of armor or weapons.
Exempli gratia: A large covenant has seven 
guilds named after their patron saints. The 
Guild of St. Peter consists of the bakers, cob-
blers, and masons of the covenant; the Guild 
of St. Luke consists of the glassmakers, physi-
cians, and bookbinders; and the Guild of St. 
Matthew contains the personal guards of the 
magi, their servants, and the senior staff. The 
Guild of St. James supports the cavalry, labor-
ers, and tanners; the Guild of St. Michael con-
tains the soldiers, sailors, and merchants; and 
the Guild of St. George contains the archers, 
armorers, and farmers. Finally, the Guild of 
St. Andrew cares for the ﬁshermen and all the 
unmarried women (once they marry, they join 
their husband’s guild; if they are widowed, they 
return to St. Andrew’s patronage).
MONASTERY
A monastery is designed along a 
guild structure. Unlike the clear hier-
archy of the noble household, the ab-
bot of a monastery designates ofﬁcials 
Story Seed: The Guild Contest
Every three years, the guilds of a 
covenant hold a contest that deter-
mines the precedence of the guilds. 
The leader of the winning guild be-
comes the steward for the next three 
years, and his guild is accorded 
many petty privileges: they are seat-
ed ﬁrst for dinner and receive bet-
ter bread and cleaner salt; they have 
ﬁrst pick of new tools; they get the 
quarters farthest from the pig-sties; 
and so forth. Sufﬁce to say, it is a se-
rious business.
The contest consists of a series 
of physical and mental trials set by 
the magi, and for as long as anyone 
can remember, one particular guild 
has won. This year, however, an-
other guild has a chance, thanks to 
a secret weapon — the player grogs. 
They have either acquired some 
magical item that will assist the guild 
in winning, or else have good rela-
tions with the magi who might be 
persuaded to help. Naturally, the in-
cumbent guild does not sit idly and 
permit their rivals to gain the upper 
hand and break their hegemony.

Grogs
to manage each aspect of the daily life 
of the monastery. These ofﬁcials are 
then responsible for meeting the mon-
astery’s needs in their department, and 
can requisition manpower and ﬁnanc-
es as needed. This is a good model for 
a small covenant, where staff need not 
be permanently designated as a cook 
or a chambermaid, but instead take on 
such roles as requested.
The abbot is the secular and spiri-
tual leader of a monastery. He appoints 
various senior obedentiaries to care 
for different departments, so the ter-
rar is in charge of the estate, the cel-
larer in charge of food, the bursar in 
charge of money, and so forth. Rather 
than having a staff or workforce as-
signed to each, these positions permit 
their holder to request the assistance 
of the other monks in the completion 
of their tasks. For more information on 
the internal structure of monasteries, 
see The Church, Chapter 4.
Exempli gratia: The covenfolk of a small 
covenant have been divided into four “guilds,” 
one serving each of the four magi (the mag-
istri). The prefect works for the magister 
militaris, and is tasked with maintaining the 
covenant’s soldiers in a battle-ready state. The 
cellarer works for the magister aediﬁcius 
and is in charge of the covenant’s mundane 
resources: its money, food, and consumables. 
The sacrist works for the magister ﬂaminis 
and is responsible for the magical resources of 
the covenant: the laboratories, the library and 
scriptorium, and gathering the vis. The herald 
works for the magister legatus, and deals 
with all outside relations with other covenants 
and with the local dignitaries. None of the 
grogs are permanently assigned to any of the 
four magi, but if vis needs to be collected, the 
sacrist pulls together a team of the most appro-
priate grogs and sends them off on a mission. 
At harvest time, the cellarer gathers most of the 
available personnel to bring in the wheat.
No Formal Structure
Some covenants have never in-
stituted any sort of structure at all 
among their covenfolk. This is usually 
only possible for very small numbers 
of covenfolk; without some sort of or-
ganization, important tasks are likely 
to be forgotten or neglected. In fact, if 
left to their own devices with no for-
mal organization imposed upon them, 
covenfolk usually seek some sort of 
structure by themselves; it is natural 
for humans to seek social order.
If the covenfolk form a strong 
cohesive group, they can all work 
together toward the common good 
without needing a formal social struc-
ture. This is not to say that everyone 
does not know who is in charge, but 
there are fewer differences between 
servant, soldier, and specialist since 
everyone lends a hand in each task.
Exempli gratia: Members of a single fam-
ily supply nine-tenths of a covenant’s work-
force. The MacKars are an ancient clan with 
a strong leader, and while they might have 
rivalries with other clans in the region, they 
also have several alliances. Every member of 
the covenant knows his place, and is trained in 
the roles to which he is best suited by an older 
relative. The clan has even produced one Gifted 
child, of whom they are inordinately fond, and 
who is now apprenticed to one of the masters.
The Life  
of a Grog
Living at a covenant usually offers 
better prospects than most peasants 
or townsfolk can otherwise expect. 
They have a job for life, so long as 
they prove useful. Food is provided 
communally, and the buildings are 
Rivalries and Tension
Any sort of social structure 
can lead to rivalries among the 
covenfolk. One nation may have 
deep-seated prejudices against an-
other (perhaps arising from racial 
or cultural incompatibilities), or a 
guild might consider its tasks more 
important than those of the other 
guilds, and seek an improved status 
for its members.
In addition to tension between 
groups of covenfolk, there can also 
be tension between prominent in-
dividuals. If the covenfolk are split 
into families, there may be a long-
standing feud between the leaders 
of two families; or there could be a 
power struggle within the turb over 
who deserves to be captain, once 
the present incumbent has retired. A 
common rivalry occurs between the 
steward and the chamberlain over 
precedence; many stewards believe 
that they should be the superior of 
the chamberlain. The turb captain 
need not be excluded from such ri-
valries; it is common for the captain 
to think himself more important 
than either, and he uses the armed 
men under his control to enforce 
this point.
MINOR RESIDENTS HOOK: 
WARRING COVENFOLK
The covenfolk are divided into 
at least two factions, who cannot 
see eye-to-eye, and this rivalry has 
gone beyond petty annoyances to a 
situation where it can occasionally 
interrupt the smooth running of the 
covenant. The magi are either un-
willing or unable to resolve what-
ever started the conﬂict, although 
their attempts might also lead to 
stories. This is not the same as ei-
ther the Divided Loyalty or Rebel-
lious Covenfolk Hooks (Covenants, 
page 19); the different factions of 
covenfolk can be equally loyal (or 
disloyal!) to the magi.

Grogs
maintained at the covenant’s expense. 
Covenfolk can expect the soldiers and 
masters of a covenant to protect them 
from the usual perils of life, such as 
bandits, marauding armies, plague and 
pestilence, and natural disasters such 
as ﬂood and ﬁre. Furthermore, it is 
likely that one’s children will also have 
a job for life, should they want it, and 
a pension is provided in one’s dotage. 
The biggest downside is living in close 
proximity to magi, not only because of 
their dubious reputation, but also due 
to all the bizarre phenomena that they 
tend to attract. This section deals with 
some of the day-to-day issues faced by 
grogs at a covenant.
The section on duties applies 
mostly to soldiers, rather than servants 
or specialists. However, the serving 
staff tend to follow similar watch pat-
terns to the soldiers, since they must 
provide food for the soldiers when 
their watches are complete, and they 
must arrange their cleaning schedules 
around their duties. The remaining 
part of this section applies equally to 
all grogs — what they do on their free 
time, how they are rewarded and pun-
ished, and what the covenant provides 
for them in terms of accommodation 
and pension.
Duties
A soldier’s time is divided into 
three periods: duty (or watch duty), 
off-duty, and free time. He actively 
guards the covenant when on duty, 
does other jobs around the covenant 
when off duty, and has self-governed 
time to himself (usually reserved for 
sleeping) when free. The turb is usu-
ally divided into two patrols (the day 
and night patrols), of roughly equal 
size. Both patrols pull a duty during 
the day and the night, but the day 
patrol has its off-duty during the day 
and sleeps at night, whereas the night 
patrol sleeps during the day and has 
its off-duty during the night. The two 
Watch Patterns
It is sometimes necessary to know what patrols certain members of the 
turb are assigned to at any one time. The following charts should help; 
randomly determine what patrol (night or day) and watch (ﬁrst to fourth) 
a character is in, then cross-reference the time to determine the type of 
duty. You may instead wish to divide all soldiers into watches ahead of time, 
so that when an event occurs, you can randomly determine which of the 
watches is on duty, letting you know which grogs have to deal with that 
event ﬁrst.
SINGLE DUTY
The grogs are divided into four watches. The day and night patrols vary 
as to when they take their off-duty and free shifts. One-quarter of the cov-
enant’s ﬁghting force is combat ready at any time, and another three-eighths 
can be mobilized quickly; the rest are asleep.

Grogs
patrols swap duties periodically, so 
that the day patrol becomes the night 
patrol and vice versa. This typically 
occurs every one to three months.
A patrol may be split further into 
different areas of the covenant, so that 
each patrol might consist of a wall pa-
trol, a gate patrol, a keep patrol, and so 
forth. However, an individual might 
not perform the same service in each 
of his duties: on one duty, he might be 
on wall guard, and on his next duty, 
he may be patrolling the tower or the 
forest. The liber gregis suggests that a 
minimum of two grogs constitute each 
sub-patrol if possible. 
The turb captain is responsible 
for keeping track of the duties and 
patrols, but a sergeant usually issues 
orders and assignments to the men. 
The grog’s mess hall usually has a peg 
board, letting a grog know where and 
when, and with whom, he is on duty. 
Each column on the board indicates a 
different patrol, and a grog ﬁnds his 
mark on the side of the board and 
reads across to discover what patrol 
he’s been assigned.
THE WATCHES
The liber gregis sets out the expect-
ed pattern of sentry duty, both on 
expedition and while stationed at the 
covenant, and the system it adopts is 
broadly based on the Roman model. 
The 24 hours of the day are divided 
into eight watches of three hours 
each: four day watches and four 
night watches.
WATCH 
COMMENCES
Eventide, 1st night watch 
6 pm
Nighttide, 2nd night watch 9 pm
Midnight, 3rd night watch Midnight

6 am
Forenoon, 2nd day watch 
9 am
Afternoon, 3rd day watch 
Noon
Foredusk, 4th day watch

Times of watches are approximate, 
based on the height of the sun during 
the day, and the rising of the moon 
or stars at night. On overcast nights, 
watch durations are even more ap-
proximate, and are usually estimated 
from the time it takes for a log the di-
ameter of a man’s arm to burn: approx-
imately one hour. During the day, the 
sergeant on watch is responsible for 
determining shift changes; at night, 
this is left to the grogs on duty.
Each patrol is divided into four 
watches. In normal sentry duty, a pa-
trol spends one watch on duty, then 
three watches off-duty. It then spends 
another watch on duty, and the next 
three watches are free time. The ﬁrst 
watch of each patrol is assigned the 
eventide watch as their duty watch, 
followed by three watches free (if the 
day patrol) or three watches off-duty 
(if the night patrol). The two second 
watches take the nighttide watch as 
their duty watch, the third watches 
commence with the midnight watch, 
and the fourth watches commence 
with the foredawn watch. The pat-
tern then repeats itself starting at the 
morntide watch. In double duty, a pa-
trol spends two watches on duty, then 
two off-duty, then two on duty, then 
has two free watches. The ﬁrst and 
second watches of both patrols start 
duty with the eventide watch, then 
are relieved by the third and fourth 
watches at midnight.
Sentry Duty
One of the most important and 
most onerous duties of a soldier is to 
stand guard over the covenant. This 
duty generally consists of standing 
out in the elements, trying to remain 
alert while absolutely nothing hap-
pens. This tedium is punctuated every 
few months or years by brief moments 
of excitement and violence. While on 
sentry duty, a grog’s patrol is assigned 
an area — the gate, a section of the 
wall, the bailey, and so forth — and 
he must be aware of anything unusual 
that he sees or hears. Of course, at a 
covenant, “unusual” has a different 
connotation than it does elsewhere; 
he may be on the lookout for a faerie 
inﬁltration, invisible thieves creeping 
in, anything up to and including a full-
on assault by a dragon!
A grog on watch duty is not per-
mitted to eat, or drink undiluted wine 
or ale. He is usually permitted a small 
ﬁre, unless ordered otherwise. He 
must remain in his armor at all times, 
and must keep at least one hand on 
his weapon. His purpose is to remain 
alert and aware of any potential dan-
gers, and, depending on his station, 
to patrol across his designated area. If 
he hears or sees anything suspicious, 
he should ﬁrst alert the other grogs of 
his duty, then the duty sergeant. Ob-
viously, he should raise the alarm for 
any immediate threats.
Characters can regain Short-
Term Fatigue while on duty or off-
duty. Normal sentry duties do not 
incur the loss of Long-Term Fatigue, 
as long as they are maintained in a 
regular fashion. If a grog’s sleeping 
time is interrupted, or he chooses to 
spend it carousing or gambling with 
his comrades, then he loses a Long-
Term Fatigue level which can be re-
gained from normal sleep when he is 
next permitted.
It may be important to determine 
whether a grog can remain awake dur-
ing his duty watches. This involves a 
Stamina + Concentration roll; failure 
indicates that the character is dozing 
or asleep. It is not necessary to roll 
for every grog on every duty — only 
if something happens during a shift is 
this absolutely necessary — but the 
storyguide should ask for occasional 
rolls anyway, to keep the players on 
their toes! Characters who are asleep 
have a –9 penalty to any Awareness 
rolls. A character who is woken up 
suddenly, in addition to still suffering 
from any Fatigue loss, has a –1 penalty

to all actions for a number of rounds 
equal to (6 – Stamina).

EASE FACTOR: 3 (single duty);  
6 (double duty); +3 for night time
PENALTY TO AWARENESS  
FOR BEING ASLEEP: –9
TIME TO RECOVER FROM  
BEING WOKEN UP:  
6 – Stamina rounds
DOUBLE DUTY
Double duty is ordered when 
trouble is expected; grogs work lon-
ger shifts, and more of them are active 
at a time. When on double duty, the 
turb is divided into two duties, and 
a grog is on watch for two watches, 
with two watches off-duty. As before, 
sleep is permitted after two active du-
ties. If possible, it is arranged so that 
half of each duty is asleep and half is 
resting. So, if four grogs are on sentry 
duty, two take the ﬁrst duty while one 
sleeps and the other is off-duty. After 
two watches, the duties switch; one 
of those who has just been on duty 
sleeps, while the other remains awake. 
In this pattern, there are always three-
quarters of the grogs awake at any one 
time, and half of them are alert, armed, 
and ready for trouble.
Double duty is tiring, and cannot 
be maintained for extended periods. 
At dusk, make Fatigue rolls for every 
grog. The Ease Factor is three, but in-
creases by one for every double duty 
watch endured since the character’s 
last normal duty (thus it increases by 
two every day). Failure results in the 
loss of one Long Term Fatigue level. 
Characters on double duty cannot 
regain Long-Term Fatigue levels until 
they change to a normal shift pattern, 
or they sleep uninterrupted for at least 
ten hours.
DOUBLE DUTY FATIGUE ROLLS:  
Stamina + simple die  
versus Ease Factor 3

DUTIES FOR SPECIALISTS  
AND SERVANTS
The working day of most special-
ists in the covenant is from forenoon 
until eventide (approximately 8 a.m. 
to 8 p.m.). If they are entitled to food 
provided by the covenant, they eat af-
ter the soldiers at dawn and dusk, and 
with them at noon. Other than that, 
they toil under their own recogni-
zance, or under the command of their 
workshop master or the steward.
Servants need to ﬁt their duties 
around the other inhabitants of the 
covenant, but tend to keep similar 
hours to the specialists. Kitchen staff 
rise earlier since breakfast needs to be 
cooked and bread prepared for the 
whole day. There is usually someone 
in the kitchen at all times, even if it 
is just a scullion stoking the ﬁres un-
der the ovens and guarding the stores 
against hungry soldiers coming off a 
watch. Chambermaids must often be 
opportunistic about when they can 
gain access to the magi’s quarters to 
clean, and become experts at slipping 
in and out without being noticed.
Off Duty
A grog off-duty is not necessar-
ily free to do what he wishes, it just 
means he does not have to patrol the 
covenant. Off-duty time is usually 
welcomed by the grogs as a relief from 
the tedium of being on watch. Off-
duty grogs may divest themselves of 
their armor if it restricts them in their 
tasks, but are encouraged to wear at 
least their under-armor padding if 
possible. For some tasks, like drilling, 
wearing armor is mandatory.
In common with most of Mythic 
Europe, two hot meals are provided 
each day: dinner is the larger meal and 
is served midway through the fore-
noon watch, and supper is served at 
the end of the foredusk watch. Grogs 
on off-duty gather in the mess hall af-
ter taking bowls of food to those on 
duty. At other times, the ability for 
a grog to get hot food depends very 
much on their personal relationship 
with the servants. However, a daily 
ration of bread, cheese, and ale is pro-
vided to each grog.
If a grog is off-duty during the 
daylight hours, then he is usually oc-
cupied on the drill ground with the 
other off-duty shifts. The drill ser-
geant puts them through their paces, 
improving their general ﬁtness and 
providing Teaching in Martial Abili-
ties. Grogs must drill together regu-
larly if they are to be able to ﬁght as a 
trained group.
Not all of a character’s off-duty 
time is occupied with drills, however. 
A soldier is expected to take care of 
his arms, armor, and kit. He must clean 
the armor and make repairs, sharpen 
any edged weapons, and smooth out 
nicks and dents. Any repairs he cannot 
perform himself must be seen to by 
the covenant’s weapon-smith. Grogs 
may also be assigned to work crews: 
assisting the teamsters in unloading 
provisions; cleaning the latrines; and, 
during the autumn, helping with the 
harvest. Furthermore, if a magus needs 
an errand boy or a test subject, the ser-
geant assigns an off-duty grog. If he 
gets time to himself with all this go-
ing on, a grog can put in some Practice 
with a particular Ability.
A grog whose off-duty watch is 
during the night has an easier time of 
it. He is usually left to catch up with 
some sleep (as long as he remains in 
minimal armor), and may be able to 
entice his buddies into an illicit dice

Grogs
game, as long as the sergeant doesn’t 
catch them.
To specialists and servants, off-
duty is much the same as free time. 
Servants work a particularly long 
day, and tend to sleep when not on 
duty; specialists usually have more 
energy to join the soldiers in their 
leisure pursuits.
Free Time
Free time is precious to all grogs; 
it is when they sleep. A grog’s daily 
routine is physically and mentally 
demanding, and, as mentioned ear-
lier, a grog who does not sleep in his 
free time suffers a Long Term Fatigue 
level until he manages to sleep for at 
least two continuous watches. Strict-
ly speaking, grogs are not permitted 
to sleep at any other time, but many 
manage to sneak a nap, at the risk of 
getting caught by the sergeant.
Grogs do not have to sleep in 
their free time; they may choose to 
spend it how they like. If they want 
to drink their wine or ale ration rath-
er than save it for the meals, they 
may do so in their free time, but only 
in the watch immediately after they 
come off duty. Being drunk on duty 
is grounds for punishment. Grogs of-
ten gamble with each other during 
their free time, either on dice or coin 
games, on tests of skill such as quoits, 
or on dog ﬁghts or cock ﬁghts. Final-
ly, a grog assigned punishment duties 
(see later) must perform them in his 
free time.
Rewards
A grog’s life might seem a hard 
one, but he is recompensed with 
food, accommodation, and a promise 
of a pension in his old age. Compared 
to the life of a serf, grogs have it easy. 
Nevertheless, it is good for morale if 
the covenant is seen to reward skill, 
good behavior, initiative, and uncom-
mon bravery. A maga who commends 
a grog to the turb captain, steward, or 
chamberlain does not usually concern 
herself with the nature of the reward, 
and rarely bestows it herself. Instead, 
the ofﬁcial himself determines an 
appropriate remuneration, and an-
nounces the reward in front of the 
rest of the turb. However, magi do 
not always recognize the importance 
to turb discipline of maintaining a 
chain of command, and sometimes 
hand out ad hoc rewards.
IMPROVED RATIONS
The fare of a grog is usually pretty 
plain, so a simple and effective way 
of rewarding a grog for a well-done 
job is to give him a one-off or tempo-
rary elevation in his provender. Typi-
cal improvements in rations include a 
private cellar of salt, wastel bread (the 
best bread available), fresh meat, or a 
double ration of wine or ale. This im-
provement in rations might last a day, 
a month, a season, or a year, depend-
ing on the magnitude of the rewarded 
behavior. A grog spending a year on 
improved rations receives a –1 im-
provement to his Living Conditions 
Modiﬁer when making aging rolls. A 
grog receiving one of the other re-
wards listed here often also receives 
improved rations as well.
PAY AND A HALF
Monetary rewards to grogs are not 
that useful; they have little opportu-
nity to spend hard coin. Neverthe-
less, grogs sometimes hoard what coin 
they can with a particular purpose in 
mind: perhaps a favor for his love, or 
a superior weapon. Pay and a Half can 
last for a season or more, or it might 
be permanent.

Grogs
IMPROVED EQUIPMENT
Covenants often gather superior 
arms and armor, either scavenged from 
the battleﬁeld, received as gifts, or 
left behind by former companions or 
grogs. They might also acquire tools 
of superior quality from former coven-
folk or from outside the covenant. 
This equipment is often given out as 
rewards. This is a little backhanded, 
since the covenant is rewarding a grog 
by making him more efﬁcient at what 
they pay him to do, but most grogs do 
not complain. This equipment might 
be Expensive rather than Standard 
cost, or it might be particularly well-
crafted and provide actual bonuses 
(see City & Guild, pages 67–71). In rare 
circumstances, a grog might be grant-
ed a lesser enchantment or even an in-
vested item, although this usually re-
quires great heroism to provoke such a 
gift. All gifts are permanent, but a grog 
who is demoted as a punishment must 
usually surrender any such equipment 
in addition to any other punishment.
PROMOTION IN RANK
The highest reward offered by 
most covenants is a promotion. A 
standard grog can be promoted to cus-
tos, and a custos may be promoted to 
sergeant, or the equivalent for servants 
and specialists. They may even aspire 
to be captain, chamberlain, or steward 
one day. Increased rank has several 
privileges — better food, better ac-
commodation, better pay, and often a 
better pension.
Punishments
The liber gregis devotes a whole 
chapter to punishments, but it is clear 
that Beorhtric was a just captain and 
only used these punishments when 
warranted. 
Without 
punishments, 
discipline cannot be maintained. It 
is also important that the covenfolk 
know that the covenant is prepared to 
inﬂict these punishments, so they are 
handed out in public before the rest of 
the covenant. These punishments are 
applied to all covenfolk, not just the 
soldiers, although it is rare for one of 
the servants to have the opportunity 
to commit an offense that warrants a 
severe penalty. One individual, often 
the drill sergeant, is usually respon-
sible for inﬂicting the punishments on 
all of the covenfolk. This presents the 
covenant as a coherent body of law to 
its inhabitants.
Corporal punishments are nor-
mally reserved for poor discipline. A 
grog who is insolent, disobedient, or 
insubordinate is subjected to physical 
punishment appropriate to the crime. 
These sorts of punishments are short, 
sharp shocks that are over with as soon 
as the wounds heal. Punishments in-
volving the withholding of privileges 
are usually applied for failure in a duty, 
and the degree of failure determines 
the severity of the punishment. This 
does not mean that, every time a mis-
sion fails, the grogs are punished; only 
if it fails because of their actions or in-
actions is discipline applied. These pu-
nitive measures are usually long term, 
or even permanent. The two types of 
punishment are often combined: for 
example, if insubordination leads to 
failure in a mission.
Punishment, if inﬂicted in an ap-
propriate manner for clear reasons, 
does not usually result in a loss of Pre-
vailing Loyalty (see Covenants, page 36, 
and Chapter 4), even if the majority of 
the covenfolk do not agree with the 
punishment. Naturally, it is appropri-
ate for the punished individual to suf-
fer a reduction in personal Loyalty, 
but this may only be temporary, and 
if the punishment is correctly applied, 
then the overall effect may actually 
be an increase in loyalty. However, if 
punishment is frequent, inconsistent, 
or disproportionate to the infraction, 
then the magi can expect the coven-
folk to become more hostile toward 
them. Punishment is not usually in-
ﬂicted by a magus, and using magic is 
speciﬁcally advised against due to the 
danger of alienating the covenfolk.
The punishments of the liber gregis 
are listed later, in order of severity. 
The crimes for which they are in-
ﬂicted have been purposefully omit-
ted; every covenant places different 
importance on infractions, and it is 
impossible to generalize. Most cov-
enants do not have a deﬁnitive list of 
crimes and their associated punish-
ments (although some do); those with 
access to the liber gregis assigns punitive 
action based on the type of crime and 
its severity.
CASTIGATION
This is the lowest level of punish-
ment, consisting of a single blow to 
the face, hand, or thigh with a rod. 
The drill sergeant usually carries such 
a rod speciﬁcally for this purpose (tra-
ditionally made from the virile organ 
of a bull), and the punishment is usu-
ally applied immediately.
RELEGATION TO INFERIOR DUTIES
Every covenant has duties that are 
considered to be the most unpleasant 
of all; these are usually drawn by lot, 
but are occasionally assigned as pun-
ishment. Typically, emptying the la-
trine pits is the worst of all jobs, but at 
a covenant, worse jobs can doubtless 
be found — feeding Master Hygwald’s 
familiar, removing the rotting corpses 
from Master Lucas’s laboratory, or ac-
companying Master Orsinio on a mis-
sion to the Black Bog of Doom.
REDUCTION OF RATIONS
Grogs usually receive basic but 
nutritious fare of good grain, occa-


--- Page ---

25
Grogs
sional meat or ﬁsh, and a daily ration 
of ale or wine. The threat of being re-
duced to barley (rather than wheat), 
having the meat ration removed, and/
or the ale exchanged for small beer 
(or worse, milk!) for a month is a 
good incentive to avoid bad behavior. 
A character who spends one or more 
season a year on reduced rations suf-
fers a +1 penalty to his Living Con-
ditions Modiﬁer; if he is on reduced 
rations for three or four seasons, the 
penalty is +2.
FLOGGING
This punishment usually takes 
place in front of the entire covenant; 
the offender takes one, ﬁve, or ten 
blows to the back from a strap. 1, 2, 
or 3 Light Wounds are inﬂicted by 
this punishment, and the offender 
takes 1, 3, or 5 long term Fatigue lev-
els as well.
REDUCTION IN RANK
Rank has its privileges: the wages 
are higher, the ration of food is better, 
and the accommodation is superior. 
Furthermore, rank has implications for 
one’s pension once one is too old to 
serve the covenant (see later). Reduc-
tion in rank is permanent; all grogs 
have the capacity to re-earn the rank 
they once held, but a captain will be 
reluctant to promote someone who 
has lost his rank through punishment.
WHIPPING
Much more brutal than simple 
ﬂogging, miscreants are sentenced to 
a number of lashes (usually a multiple 
of 10), made with either the long whip 
or the short whip, with the latter be-
ing the more severe punishment. 10 
lashes inﬂicts a Light Wound, 30 lash-
es a Medium Wound, and 50 lashes 
a Heavy Wound. If the short whip is 
used, 2 wounds of each type are in-
ﬂicted. The punished grog is permit-
ted just one week to recover from his 
lashes (just one day if ten or fewer are 
inﬂicted); if he cannot work after this 
time has elapsed (which is likely if he 
received more than ten lashes), then 
his pay is docked for the time he takes 
to recover.
DISMISSAL
Being dismissed from the service of 
a covenant is a step rarely taken light-
ly. Covenants value their privacy, and 
dismissing a grog from a steady job 
is likely to leave that individual har-
boring a great deal of resentment that 
could be used against the covenant. 
Of course, magi have ways of securing 
silence, from simple threats and sham 
curses, to more direct magical mea-
sures, such as mutilation of the tongue 
and modiﬁcation of the memory.
FUSTUARIUM
The most extreme punishment 
suggested by the liber gregis is for the 
malefactor to be beaten to death with 
clubs or stones. This form of justice is 
often meted out by the rest of the turb, 
who wear blindfolds. This is so that 
the character who inﬂicts the death 
blow cannot be identiﬁed, absolving 
him from any personal responsibility, 
and instead leaving the whole group 
accountable for the death sentence. 
Very few covenants actually have the 
legal right to order the death of their 
men, so this group responsibility can 
be important if the death becomes 
known in the wider community. How-
ever, since many grogs are misﬁts or 
outcasts, their death often goes un-
noticed and unremarked. Beorhtric 
writes that he has only ever heard of 
this punishment being applied once, 
and never ordered it himself.
Accommodation
Grogs usually have a section of 
the covenant set aside for them. This 
is usually divided into servants’ quar-
ters, soldiers’ quarters, and specialists’ 
quarters, more for practical reasons 
than anything else. Soldiers in par-
ticular, with irregular watch duties, 
can easily disturb the sleep of oth-
ers. These quarters usually consist of 
a large room; each grog is assigned 
a bunk and a chest in which to keep 
personal belongings. Custodes and 
higher ranks occasionally have pri-
vate rooms, or at least bunks further 
from the drafts and closer to the ﬁre. 
Married covenfolk often have a sepa-
rate room.
There is usually a single mess hall 
set aside for all grogs to eat together, 
but because of watch patterns not ev-
eryone eats at the same time.
Families
It would be a very unusual cove-
nant that didn’t actively encourage its 
covenfolk to get married. It is the duty 
of all Christian men to marry, and 
have children; and it is certainly useful 
to the covenant to raise the next gen-
eration of covenfolk. After all, being 
exposed to The Gift at an early age 
means that, by the time adolescence is 
reached, the child will have grown ac-
customed to the adverse effects of the 
magi’s presence.
Because of a general reluctance 
to bring outsiders into the closed 
community of a covenant, matches 
between the covenfolk are encour-
aged. Describing the courtship and 
eventual marriage of a favored grog 
is an excellent way to add depth to 
these characters, and have the play-
ers invest deeply in the sense of com-
munity that their covenant should 
engender.

Grogs
RETIREMENT
As a grog gets old, and decrepitude 
sinks its inescapable claws into him, 
there might come a time when the 
troop decides to retire him. Old grogs 
are valued by magi because they are 
usually exceptionally competent and 
less likely to react badly to The Gift, 
and yet as a character ages, he may be 
inclined toward lighter duties. The de-
cision to retire often comes suddenly, 
after a serious aging crisis that leaves 
the character crippled or weakened.
Assuming that a covenant cares 
for its retired members, the grog is 
still counted as a member of the cov-
enant as far as its ﬁnances go. Some 
covenants move retired grogs to a 
secondary location where they can 
live out their ﬁnal years in peace, but 
others prefer to keep them around to 
act as babysitters, sources of informa-
tion or training, and perhaps to still 
ply a trade if it does not impose stren-
uous demands.
PENSIONS
A grog’s pension is one of the en-
ticements that keeps a grog at the 
covenant. Few professions allow their 
members to continue to draw a wage 
after their working life has ended, 
but ever since Rome, this has been 
the prerogative of the professional 
soldier, and many covenants have ex-
tended this right to all of their grogs. 
Pensions are usually half to three-
quarters of their former pay. Cov-
enants occasionally charge rent for 
the accommodation of their retired 
members (and thus avoid having to 
pay them any pension), but still pro-
vide food free of charge.
A widow is normally granted the 
pension that would have been owed 
her deceased husband. In any case, 
the widow of a grog is usually cared 
for by the other grogs who worked 
with her husband.

Troupe styles vary greatly. Some 
may use grogs purely as supporting 
cast, and focus the action only on 
the magi and companions. Other sa-
gas detail the background and life of 
each grog in detail, and their person-
alities are as complex as those of any 
other character. Most troupes tend 
to fall somewhere between these two 
extremes. Whatever the style of play, 
stories that only involve grog charac-
ters can be very rewarding.
This chapter is all about grog-only 
stories. First, it presents some ideas 
for why grog-only stories might be 
desirable, with some story seeds illus-
trating this type of adventure. Next, 
it discusses the planning of grog sto-
ries, with some typical genres that one 
might employ, and some consideration 
of important elements of such stories 
— why the magi are not around, de-
signing your antagonist for non-mag-
ical opponents, and so forth. Finally, 
it describes some saga concepts that 
involve only grog characters.
Themes for 
Grog Stories
This section describes some themes 
that illustrate why you might want to 
run some all-grog stories rather than 
more standard stories for Ars Magica 
Fifth Edition involving magi and com-
panions. These stories can be woven 
into a normal saga, or played out as 
part of a grog-only saga.
Showcasing
Grog stories are an excellent way 
to introduce features of medieval life 
to a troupe. When magi are involved, 
they often concentrate on where the 
action is. They are important people, 
after all, and have little time to get 
involved in the minutiae of peasant 
life. In any case, there are many de-

Chapter Three
Switching Storyguides
Grog stories are perfect op-
portunities to introduce guest sto-
ryguides, or give a beta storyguide 
a turn in the chair (ArM5, page 
220). Since grog adventures by 
their very nature do not involve 
magi, they cannot usually inter-
fere with the alpha storyguide’s 
plots or make major alterations to 
the covenant. In the case of a beta 
storyguide, grog stories could form 
a series of interconnected stories 
running parallel to the alpha sto-
ryguide’s schemes.

mands on the time of the magus: he 
must prepare a case for the next tri-
bunal; attend a meeting of the cov-
enant’s council, where the business of 
the count will be debated; review the 
work that the illuminator did on his 
new summa; and that fool apprentice 
cannot be relied upon to keep the 
contents of the copper cauldron on a 
rolling boil …
In grog-only adventures, the story 
can be taken at a more leisurely pace. 
A grog might actually be interested in 
judging the prize cow at the county 
fair, acting as a juror (or witness) at 
a local trial, or attending the May 
Day celebrations at his home village. 
When a storyguide has been doing 
some research into a facet of the day-
to-day life of the Middle Ages and 
wants to share it with the troupe, a 
grog adventure is a great way of do-
ing this.
Routine Duties
Many standard stories in Ars 
Magica Fifth Edition involve the 
magi discovering a new vis source, 
making alliances with supernatu-
ral entities, and so forth. However, 
once the initial adventure has been 
had, the process of harvesting the 
vis source, or exchanging favors 
with the dragon, or whatever, tends 
to fade into the mundane routine of 
the covenant. It falls to the grogs to 
fulﬁll these duties. Occasionally it is 
worth reminding the players what is 
involved in such “routine duties” by 
staging a grog adventure. Naturally, 
the object of the story is the duty 
itself, but this time out the mission 
does not go smoothly, and the grogs 
are forced to adapt to the changing 
circumstances.
Plot Staging, 
Development,  
and Exposition
Related to the previous two con-
cepts, a grog story is a good way to 
feed information to the players in a 
subtle manner. Rather than tell them 
that they hear rumors of a bandit 
group in the region, the storyguide 
can have the grogs encounter them on 
the way back from a routine duty. The 
leader of these bandits may prove to 
be signiﬁcant in a later story, but the 
grogs already have a past history with 
some of the bandits, which enriches 
the experience for all.
In addition to using grogs to set up 
a future story, they can also be used 
to advance a current plot. If the magi 
need some research done, they need 
not do it themselves — send out the 
grogs to canvass the town for rumors, 
or search the library for clues. Any 
Story Seeds: Routine Duties
LOST SHEEP
The grogs sent to gather vis 
are confronted by a horde of an-
gry peasants. It seems that the 
last couple of times that the grogs 
have passed this way, sheep have 
gone missing immediately after; 
this time the villagers have been 
expecting the strangers, and have 
lain in wait for them. It seems that, 
on each visit to the vis source, the 
grogs disturb some sort of super-
natural creature, which goes on a 
rampage right after they have left 
the region.
STOLEN VIS
The grogs have traveled a great 
distance to gather the vis from a 
distant source, only to discover 
that it has already been harvested. 
There are signs that the perpetra-
tors of the theft might still be in the 
area, so the loyal grogs are tempted 
to investigate rather than return 
empty handed.
Story Seeds: Showcasing
INNOCENT OR GUILTY?
A grog is accused of a crime by a 
freeman. He could be innocent but 
framed, or he could be inadvertently 
guilty — while soldiers might not 
think twice about killing those who 
molest their masters, this is still a 
crime. The grog is ordered to attend 
court to answer for his crimes, and 
should probably consult a lawyer. 
He must then cope with the intrica-
cies of Mythic Europe’s legal system, 
which is often less about proving 
guilt or innocence, and more about 
testing the justice of a law. Depend-
ing on the saga’s location and the 
nature of the crime, trial by ordeal 
might be ordered.
A NOBLE HUNT
A noble friend of the magi in-
vites them on a hunt, and they 
bring their grogs along for the 
event. Hunting in Mythic Europe is 
a popular past time ﬁlled with ritual 
and tradition. Hunts are organized 
by the nobility, but the common 
man takes part, as trackers, hunts-
men, and so forth. Of course, when 
the hounds pick up the scent of the 
Great White Stag, the hunt can be-
come a lot more interesting …

time that the magi entrust a task to 
their subordinates, making this into a 
story has greater potential than sim-
ply reporting back the information 
that is learned. The characters learn 
the information, but also get an ap-
preciation of what is needed to gain 
that information.
Light Relief
After several sessions of intense ac-
tion, a grog adventure that bears no 
relation to the current story can pro-
vide valuable light relief for a troupe. 
In such stories, the players need not 
usually worry about the politics of the 
Order, the correct magical approach, 
or even (in some cases) the conse-
quences of their actions.
Light relief stories need not be 
comical, but comedy can play an 
important role in a saga. Those play-
ers who don’t want to trivialize their 
magus or companion can have great 
fun using their grog in a humorous 
encounter with Freddie the Fart Fa-
erie. Be aware that this might not be 
to everyone’s tastes, however! The 
important feature of a light relief 
story is not cheap laughs, but a lack 
of consequences. Light relief should 
not be part of a continuing story, 
or deliver important information to 
the characters, but instead should be 
self-contained.
History Intervenes
Bound as they are by the Code of 
Hermes, magi remain passive observ-
ers to most events of mundane history. 
However, such events need not go un-
remarked in a saga. Grog adventures 
can provide a historical backdrop, and 
allow players to experience history 
directly. Perhaps grogs are concerned 
about rescuing their families from the 
path of an advancing army. Maybe 
they are in a city on a routine mission 
when a food riot starts. For a more 
hands-on approach, grogs could make 
— or even alter — history. Many his-
torical ﬁgures die in mishaps, riots, or 
mysterious circumstances, and an in-
ventive storyguide can ﬁnd a way to 
involve the grogs. Still more notables 
escape death through the deft work 
of a physician, through sheer luck, or 
through the beneﬁcence of strangers; 
once again, grogs could play a role 
here without implicating the covenant 
Story Seeds: Staging
FLASHBACK
The magi have been plagued by 
a major foe, such as a dragon, and 
after several incidents decide to do 
something about it. They need to 
know where the dragon lives, which 
might occasion an (Area) Lore roll 
from one of the grogs who grew 
up in the region. Instead of simply 
telling the players that information, 
the storyguide instead runs a short 
“ﬂashback” story to a time before 
the grog joined the covenant. He 
was exploring the woods with some 
of his boyhood friends (some of the 
other grogs) when one of them fell 
into a sinkhole. It becomes clear 
over the course of this story that this 
was the entrance to the dragon’s lair, 
although the grogs saw no evidence 
of the beast at the time. Not only 
do the magi get the information 
they need, but they can also plan 
their approach using the grogs’ per-
sonal experience of the region. The 
grogs may have even accidentally 
discovered the dragon’s weakness, 
although they didn’t recognize it as 
such at the time.
FORESHADOWING
The grogs are tasked with ﬁnding 
someone in the local town who can 
make gold jewelry. While they search 
for such an individual, they come 
across an old woman who is worried 
because her grandson has gone miss-
ing. This event is entirely tangential 
to ﬁnding a goldsmith, but the grand-
son is an important seed for a later 
story; by introducing him to the char-
acters now, they are more likely to get 
involved in the later story.
Story Seeds: Light Relief
A FAERIE TRICK
A faerie decides to play a trick 
on a village, and everyone wakes 
up one morning looking like Si-
mon the Basket-Weaver. While 
they struggle with the confusion 
this brings, several enterprising vil-
lagers decide to perform petty acts 
of mischief and revenge on one 
another, since this is a day without 
consequence — no one can be sure 
who did what. The grogs might be 
passing through and be affected by 
the curse, or they might be left to 
try to disentangle who is respon-
sible for stealing their goods.
OVERINDULGENCE
The grogs attend a May Day cel-
ebration at the local village, which 
involves a great deal of food and 
drink. When they wake up, they are 
stranded far from the village, and 
someone has stolen their clothes. 
They must ﬁnd their way back to 
the covenant, and avoid being seen 
by the village priest who is calling 
everyone to church.

Grogs
through their actions. 
If you permit your players close 
proximity with real history, you must 
be prepared for things to not go the 
way you anticipate. You should come 
to a decision whether you want the 
player characters to be able to make 
major changes to history, and whether 
the signiﬁcant events of Mythic Eu-
rope need to match those of the real 
world. Some troupes are comfortable 
with the fact that, while the history of 
Mythic Europe has paralleled that of 
historical Europe at least as far as the 
13th century, it may not necessarily 
continue in that vein. Other troupes 
prefer to retain history as a backdrop 
rather than a story element. Make sure 
you know where your players’ opin-
ions lay before messing with the river 
of time. In any case, allowing grog 
stories to intersect with history will 
probably result in less disruption than 
stories involving magi, so grog-only 
stories may be the safest kind.
Epic Battles
The Order of Hermes is speciﬁ-
cally forbidden from interfering with 
the affairs of mundanes. Neverthe-
less, a covenant can easily ﬁnd itself 
caught up in local politics; Mythic 
Europe in the 13th century is a time 
of political upheaval, and military 
clashes between neighboring pow-
ers are frequent (if not actually com-
mon). Furthermore, most covenants 
have a force of ﬁghting men, which 
has probably come to the notice 
of the local nobility, who prefer to 
maintain a monopoly over profes-
sional soldiers.
Even if a covenant avoids being 
caught up in wars among mundanes, 
they may still ﬁnd themselves in-
volved in mass warfare, with them-
selves as either the victim or the ag-
gressor. Once the magi have prepared 
the ground, using their magic to for-
tify their men, spy on the enemy, and 
snipe at the opposing forces, most of 
the hard work is still done with sword 
and shield. Magi can have a quite lim-
ited role to play once battle is joined, 
and the larger the force, the less im-
pact they have. 
A grog story revolving around the 
covenant’s actions in a battle is a good 
way of summarizing the course of the 
war as a whole. The role of grogs in 
these stories should be limited to 
small-scale vignettes that highlight 
the speciﬁcs of the battle, and perhaps 
can change its course; Lords of Men de-
votes a chapter to the involvement 
of player characters in mass warfare, 
by focusing on the actions of small 
squads of men as microcosms of the 
day’s ﬁghting.
Story Seeds: History
LONG LIVE THE KING?
In 1223, King Louis VIII is 
crowned King of France. He had 
formerly been crowned King of 
England after he invaded on the 
death of King John; after eighteen 
months of ﬁghting he was driven 
out, and the Treaty of Lambeth 
forced him to agree that he was 
never a legitimate king of England. 
Understandably, Louis VIII was 
unpopular in English circles, and 
throughout his reign he harassed 
Angevin territories in France, fought 
with the Count of Champagne, ar-
ranged the excommunication of the 
Count of Toulouse and declared a 
crusade against the southern bar-
ons. He dies in 1226, apparently of 
dysentery. There is a lot of potential 
to get grogs bound up in the short 
reign of this king. If the covenant is 
pro-French then they might receive 
word of plots against the crown. An 
anti-French covenant might be con-
spirators in (or instigators of) these 
plots. All this could occur without 
the knowledge of the magi.
THE FIFTH CRUSADE
The Fifth Crusade is in full swing 
in 1220. As an opening to a saga, this 
Crusade presents a dramatic back-
drop to life as a grog. The two-year 
siege of Damietta has just ended, 
and the crusaders are now ﬁghting 
over secular and religious authority 
in the port. Francis of Assisi arrived 
late last year, and has been preach-
ing to the sultan; it is thought that 
he is now visiting Palestine but his 
whereabouts are unknown. The 
Crusade is about to march on Cairo. 
The players could begin with grog 
characters who are men-at-arms 
in the crusading force. They could 
meet up with the magi after a few 
battles; perhaps they are trying to 
smuggle ancient artifacts from the 
Egyptian tombs before the crusaders 
arrive, or maybe the magi are pro-
viding support to the crusaders.
Story Seeds: Epic Battles
In the early 13th century, there is 
much to be had in the way of epic 
battles. In addition to the Fifth Cru-
sade, there is the Livonian Crusade 
against the Baltic states, and the Al-
bigensian Crusade against the Pro-
vençal barons. The reconquista is on-
going on the Spanish peninsula, and 
there is still an Arabic state in Sic-
ily. As well as these large-scale wars, 
there are numerous smaller conﬂicts 
between kings and their vassals.

Grogs
Personal Stories
Last but not least, grog stories can 
feature the achievement of an indi-
vidual’s or group’s personal goals. This 
can be as prosaic as detailing a grog’s 
courtship of his true love, or as melo-
dramatic as a quest by a blood broth-
erhood to exact revenge on the mon-
ster that slew their beloved leader. 
Personal stories occasionally result in 
changes to the character, in the form 
of transformation (see Chapter 5), but 
this should always be the focus of the 
story, rather than incidental. 
Planning  
Grog Stories
In some cases, a grog story can af-
ford to be simpler in structure than 
a story involving magi. The sheer 
versatility of a Hermetic magus, and 
the inventive uses to which magic can 
be put can occasionally leave a sto-
ryguide stumped as to how to pitch a 
challenge correctly. However, things 
are much more straightforward with 
a group of grogs, who have a much 
more predictable skill set. This need 
not make the stories any less excit-
ing, though. This section offers some 
general advice for planning grog sto-
ries once the theme has been chosen. 
Picking a genre is often a good start. 
Where is the focus of the story? Are 
the grogs solving mysteries, or ﬁght-
ing their way out of trouble? This 
section goes on to discuss the sim-
ple structure of a story, and the ele-
ments that should be considered at 
each stage. Realms of Power: Faerie has a 
whole chapter devoted to the telling 
of faerie stories, and it is full of good 
advice for constructing folkloric tales 
in general, in addition to stories that 
speciﬁcally feature faeries.
Story Seeds: Personal Stories
A FALLEN COMRADE
The turb of grogs is determined 
to retrieve the body of a comrade 
slain on a distant task; because of the 
constraints of the mission, they were 
forced to bury him far from home. 
They have sought and received per-
mission from the magi, and set out. 
After overcoming various obstacles 
to get to the burial site, they discov-
er that the makeshift grave is empty, 
so they must seek out the graverob-
bers. On the way home, they could 
easily slip on to a faerie trod (Realms 
of Power: Faerie, page 17), since these 
are commonly roads of the dead.
CLAIM JUMPERS
A grog’s father arrives at the cov-
enant and asks for help. His father is 
a freeman who has a farm some vil-
lages over, but has been driven from 
his holding by an aggressive family 
that seems to have a legitimate deed 
over the land. The reeve refuses to 
get involved; as far as he’s concerned, 
as long as the rent is paid, he has lit-
tle interest in who pays it. The grog 
character must restore ownership 
and occupation of his family farm, 
but ﬁrst has to prove that the inter-
lopers have no right — and expose 
the reeve as being in their pocket.

Grogs
Story Genres
There are seven genres that lend 
themselves well to grog stories: Ac-
tion/Adventure, Comedy, Creature 
Feature, Drama, Exploration, Horror, 
and Mystery. However, one should 
note that these broad genres are 
not mutually exclusive, and a story 
can always switch genres midway 
through to help keep the players on 
their toes.
ACTION/ADVENTURE
This is the type of story with 
which most grogs feel at home. Ac-
tion/Adventures usually feature com-
bat quite heavily, but this should not 
be all they contain. Chases, physical 
challenges, and a well-chosen “bad 
guy” who employs unusual tactics all 
add to the fun. Stories based around 
disasters can also make good grog 
stories. Action stories are usually 
heavy on the doing and light on the 
thinking; don’t get too bound up in 
complex plots.
Examples include:
• A bandit moves into an area near 
the family of one of the grogs. 
He is holding the children hos-
tage to ensure the villagers’ com-
pliance, and to make them steal 
from their neighbors to line his 
pockets.
• Grogs track down a villainous lord 
who tortured and killed their cap-
tain in a previous story. The magi 
were unable to punish him be-
cause of the Code, but they might 
provide surreptitious help to the 
vengeful grogs.
• A ﬁre in a town spreads quickly. 
The grogs must do their best to 
preserve their favorite establish-
ments, and help those trapped in 
burning houses. But who started 
the ﬁre, and how?
COMEDY
Comedy has an incidental role in 
many stories, but it can also be an in-
tentional element. Humor can be very 
individual and idiosyncratic, and a 
storyguide has a duty toward his play-
ers to pitch a comedic story appropri-
ately so that it is enjoyed equally by 
the players and the storyguide. Not 
everyone appreciates the sophomoric 
character of slapstick or toilet humor, 
whereas others have difﬁculty with 
subtly crafted irony.
Not all stories of the Comedy 
genre need to be Light Relief. Com-
edy can highlight odd medieval cus-
toms, deal with plot development, or 
cover personal developments in the 
lives of grogs, just as straight stories 
can. Furthermore, comedy can be 
dark as well as light, and stories of 
this genre can have serious or even 
fatal consequences.
Don’t be tempted to use faeries 
simply because you are planning a 
comedy story. This has been an over-
used trope in previous editions of Ars 
Magica, but the current edition has 
redeﬁned the nature of faerie, and 
whimsy is less of a feature of these 
creatures now. Nevertheless, there are 
faeries who derive vitality from hu-
man laughter, although the faerie itself 
is never laughing with the characters 
— it is laughing at them, or it is being 
laughed at by them.
Examples include:
• The grogs are asked by a friend to 
help him woo his lady love. He has 
an over-elaborate plan to elevate 
himself above his rivals for her af-
fections. The lady herself is selﬁsh 
with an overbearing and disap-
proving mother, and her sister — a 
better match for the besotted grog 
— is deeply and hopelessly in love 
with him. Add the jealous suitors 
into the mix, and you have all the 
elements of a classic farce.
• Many parts of Mythic Europe 
have a tradition similar to the 
French poisson d’avril (literally, 
“April ﬁsh,”). An individual is cho-
sen by lot — the methods vary by 
locale and class — and that per-
son becomes the de facto ruler for 
a time. All men must obey the 
poisson’s dictates, no matter how 
silly. The poisson may rule for 
a single day, or for longer (such 
as the 12 nights between Christ-
mas and Epiphany). A child — or 
worse, a faerie — elected poisson 
can wreak havoc, and the charac-
ters might be in charge of damage 
limitation, or else caught up in the 
caprices of the “king for a day.” 
• A group of grogs are transformed 
into animals through an unknown 
agency, and they must make their 
way back to the covenant to have 
the enchantment undone. On the 
way, they experience the commu-
nities and social structures of other 
animals, and come to realize that 
they are a parody of human society 
as a whole.
CREATURE FEATURE
Usually a subgenre of Action/Ad-
venture, this type of story focuses on 
a speciﬁc opponent. The set-up of the 
story is usually speciﬁcally geared to 
give the antagonist the most advan-
tages possible.
Examples include:
• A basilisk has taken up residence 
right on top of one of the cov-
enant’s vis sources. This horrible 
creature can only be defeated by 
an Eagle of Virtue — but the grogs 
must convince the noble bird to 
nullify the basilisk’s deadly power 
so that they can defeat it on more 
equal terms.
• A werewolf is terrorizing a vil-
lage. Everyone suspects the reclu-

Grogs
sive woodsman, but the grogs can 
provide him with a perfect alibi. 
The lycanthrope must instead 
be one of the villagers, and the 
characters have to trick him into 
revealing himself before he kills 
them all.
• A hedge witch has taken a par-
ticular dislike to one of the grogs 
— for real or imagined reasons. 
Whenever he leaves the covenant 
he risks being harried by her, so he 
decides to drum up a few friends 
and sort her out. However, she is 
well-protected. She uses the local 
animals as her eyes and ears, and 
has trapped the land around her 
home with mundane and magical 
traps. She may have ensorcelled 
one or more warriors to act as a 
bodyguard, or have more overtly 
supernatural assistance.
DRAMA
Situations fraught with tension 
rather than action are the hallmark 
of a good dramatic story, and the cut-
and-thrust of politics can be every bit 
as exciting as battle for the right grog. 
Drama-based stories usually need a 
good plot to hold them together, since 
the players don’t have so many com-
bats to distract them.
Examples include:
• A wedding attended by the grogs is 
crashed by a band of courtly faer-
ies. The grogs must negotiate their 
way through the obscure rules of 
etiquette to ﬁnd out why these fa-
eries believe they have a claim on 
the bridegroom.
• A war has destroyed many fami-
lies in the local area, and the 
grogs are approached to help 
bring some of the refugees to 
safety. What the grogs may not 
know when they agree is that 
the refugees are Jews (or another 
denigrated minority), leaving the 
grogs to struggle with their own 
prejudices, as well as those of the 
world around them.
• A grog meets and falls in love with 
an unattainable individual. Perhaps 
she is the daughter of a noblemen, 
and he just a stable boy. Or maybe 
he is a magus, and she is a sol-
dier. The grog must contend with 
the possibility that his beloved 
has ulterior motives for returning 
his affections. This drama could 
span several months or years until 
the two ﬁnally resolve their star-
crossed love.
EXPLORATION
These stories feature new experi-
ences or take place in exotic locales, 
and may be combined with action or 
with drama.
Examples include:
• A grog was forced to leave his fa-
ther’s sword in the body of a faerie 
on a recent adventure; he wants 
it back. However, the faerie has 
become something else now and 
the sword has become integral 
to that change. The grog and his 
comrades must succeed in the 
challenges posed by the faerie to 
regain the sword.
• The grogs are shipwrecked on a 
mysterious island, and the magi are 
nowhere to be found. The secret to 
escaping from this regio must be 
somewhere on the island, but can 
they ﬁnd it alone?
• The grogs are required to deliver 
a magical item to the king of the 
monkeys. When they step across 
the borders of his land, they ﬁnd 
themselves transformed into mon-
keys themselves. To complete 
their mission, they must foil a plot 
of the monkeys’ enemies, the ser-
pent people.
HORROR
Ars Magica Fifth Edition is a good 
setting for horror stories. Mythic Eu-
rope is rich in suitable opponents 
— ghosts, demons, werewolves, 
vampires — and abounds with suit-
ably creepy locations, such as haunt-
ed forests, abandoned castles, and 
fog-shrouded moors. In addition to 
maintaining the atmosphere, the sto-
ryguide should build tension through 
inconclusive encounters until the 
ﬁnal confrontation. Horror stories 
make extensive use of Personality 
Traits (particularly the Brave Trait), 
and madness can be represented by 
the temporary imposition of Per-
sonality Traits at high values that 
govern the character’s reactions to 
certain stimuli. Stories that are all 
about ﬁghting a monster rather than 
running from it are creature features, 
rather than horror.
Examples include:
• An abandoned farmhouse has been 
occupied by a particularly unpleas-
ant faerie. It has become a test of 
manhood to spend a night in the 
farmhouse and return with an item 
from inside to prove it.
• The grogs are at the covenant, 
but virtually everyone else is ab-
sent, including the magi. Strange 
things start to happen, including 
disappearances or even deaths. It 
soon becomes apparent that a de-
mon is loose in the covenant. But 
how did it get through the Aegis of 
the Hearth?
• The grogs are hunting (perhaps 
illegally), but they slowly realize 
that instead they are the ones be-
ing hunted. They never see their 
pursuer clearly, but are herded to-
ward the creature’s lair where it is 
best able to dispatch them — or so 
it hopes.

MYSTERY
Mystery adventures rely less on 
combat and more on quick-wittedness 
and sharp eyes. These stories can be 
more fun without magi, who can often 
easily solve mysteries with magic. Be 
careful not to allow a mystery adven-
ture to devolve into a set of Perception 
+ Awareness rolls to spot clues.
Examples include:
• A disease is afﬂicting the grogs, 
but it has no apparent cause and 
the physicians are bafﬂed. Clues 
point toward a grog who died re-
cently, but why would he have had 
a grudge against the covenant?
• The oblates at a local monastery 
are going missing. They’ve been 
trying to cover it up, but eventu-
ally a boy connected to one of 
the covenfolk becomes a victim. 
Where are they going, and is the 
monastery involved?
• The agent of the covenant’s mer-
chant contact is found hanged in 
a warehouse. He is discovered to 
have been involved in the sale of 
stolen relics. But who murdered 
him — the thieves, a rival, or a dis-
gruntled buyer?
The Beginning
The beginning of any grog story 
lacks a key ingredient that many sto-
ries for Ars Magica Fifth Edition have: 
a Story Flaw. The storyguide can usu-
ally be sure that a certain set of com-
panion or magi characters will take 
part in any given adventure because 
it plays on one of their Story Flaws. 
Since grogs cannot have Story Flaws, 
the storyguide must use other meth-
ods for getting the characters involved 
in the stories.
The most common method is sim-
ply handing down orders to the grogs. 
They are, after all, the employees of 
a covenant, which they rely on for 
wages, homes, and food. However, it 
soon becomes a clichéd way to start 
an adventure. Here are a few alternate 
ideas. Furthermore, some of the story 
themes mentioned earlier lend them-
selves to particular story seeds, as the 
characters react to events imposed 
upon them.
Example include:
• A mysterious lady dressed all in 
green asks the grogs for help.
• A character known to one of the 
grogs calls in a favor he is owed.
• The grog characters are ambushed 
on their way to a nearby town.
• The grog characters are tricked 
into getting involved by a cun-
ning priest.
WHERE ARE THE MAGI?
An important question to ask 
when planning a grog adventure is 
why the magi or companions aren’t 
getting involved. Some types of story 
are of more intrinsic interest to magi, 
or involve the Story Flaws of the 
“main cast,” but conventional stories 
in Ars Magica Fifth Edition are not 
intended to feature grogs exclusively. 
The storyguide sometimes needs to 
provide some pretext as to why the 
magi and companions are unavailable 
for these stories.
Example include:
• The magi are absent from the cov-
enant: perhaps they are at tribunal, 
or visiting an ally, or ﬁghting a 
dragon with the rest of the turb.
• The magi are at the covenant, but 
unable or unwilling to be distract-
ed. The grog story might be related 
to the circumstance that prevents 
the magi from taking part. For ex-
ample, the casting of the Aegis of the 
Hearth leaves a window every year 
in which all the magi are occupied 
for an hour or two. 
• The grogs are accompanying one 
or more of the covenant’s appren-
tices on their ﬁrst adventure be-
yond the covenant gates.
• The story initially presents itself 
as business normally assigned to 
grogs, such as vis collection.
• The story is the personal business 
of one or more grogs.
• The grogs speciﬁcally want to ex-
clude the magi, knowing that they 
won’t approve or consent to the 
story. This could be a minor act of 
rebellion (visiting a bordello) or a 
major one (disobeying orders not 
to return for the dragon’s treasure).
• The grogs are given the assignment 
by the magi. Perhaps the journey is 
too long for them to bother with, 
or too boring (apparently) to pique 
their interest.
• Sometimes the magi choose not 
to come along when they really 
should have. On occasion, a sto-
ryguide presents a story seed too 
subtly for his players, and they 
assign a group of grogs to check 
Sources of Inspiration
A storyguide should not be 
frightened of borrowing from mod-
ern ﬁlms and TV series to construct 
stories. Such sources are usually 
pretty good for grog stories, since 
their protagonists do not rely on 
magic to get them out of a hole ei-
ther (although sufﬁciently-advanced 
technology can substitute indistin-
guishably for magic). Inspiration 
can derive from all sorts of shows 
and ﬁlms. Just make sure that your 
players are not too familiar with 
your sources, or they might spot the 
plot even after you have reframed it 
in a Mythic European setting!

Grogs
out the issue. This might end in 
tragedy for the grogs if they are 
outmatched against a supernatu-
ral opponent.
• The grogs could be traitors to 
the covenant, and actually work-
ing against it. This works best 
with grogs who have not yet been 
played — they were always trai-
tors, but only now has the oppor-
tunity for treachery presented it-
self. However, known grogs could 
be enchanted by hostile powers to 
betray their masters.
• The magi accompany the grogs, 
but are separated from them in the 
early phase of the story. The grogs 
might be sent away by the magi 
— to get help, to explore, and so 
forth — or the separation might be 
due to misadventure.
• The magi cannot get involved be-
cause of the dictates of the Code of 
Hermes. By sending grogs with no 
magical aid, they hope to bypass 
the tribunal’s wrath.
The Middle
The middle of any story should 
have a gradual increase in tension 
or action, or both, as the characters 
build toward the climax that happens 
in the ﬁnale. The three basic ways of 
building tension in the middle phase 
of a story are antagonists, clues, and 
obstacles.
ANTAGONISTS
Most stories have an antagonist, 
which may be an event, a person or 
creature, or a place. It is the source of 
most of the signiﬁcant obstacles that 
the grogs will face, and many stories 
revolve around overcoming or defeat-
ing the antagonist. This need not be 
the case for all stories: the antagonist 
might be so vast that it must simply be 
weathered rather than defeated, or so 
powerful that it is not possible for the 
grogs to defeat it.
Events as antagonists usually fall 
into the “undefeatable” category. A 
plague or an outbreak of war could be 
an antagonist, as could a natural disas-
ter such as an avalanche or forest ﬁre. 
In such cases, merely surviving might 
be enough to satisfy the goals of the 
story, but minimizing the loss of life 
or rescuing valuable artifacts could be 
the source of drama instead.
Antagonists that are personiﬁed in 
an individual are more familiar to most 
troupes. Stories designed for servants 
and specialists rather than soldiers of-
ten have antagonists who attempt to 
outwit, outmaneuver, or escape the 
characters while simultaneously pur-
suing their nefarious schemes.
Physical threats are not generally 
an issue in a grog adventure; ﬁghting 
is what most grogs have been trained 
for, and even if the magi had been 
present, they would not be involved 
in this part of the story anyhow. On 
the other hand, even weak supernatu-
ral creatures can pose a major threat. 
Grogs have no Magic Resistance at all, 
and are almost certain to fall under the 
inﬂuence of any powers or spells that 
are thrown against them. For instance, 
take the Terrifying Howl power of the 
Magical Wolf (ArM5, page 193). This 
power has a Penetration Total of zero, 
meaning that magi are only affected 
in very unusual circumstances. How-
ever, few grogs are going to be able 
to achieve the Brave roll of Ease Fac-
tor 12 to throw off its effects, and only

Grogs
a quarter of even the bravest grogs in 
the band are likely to stay and ﬁght 
if the power is brought to bear. This 
makes creatures like the magical wolf a 
very different challenge to an all-grog 
group. When grogs enter into ﬁghts, 
a trained group can be devastatingly 
effective against even a tough foe, and 
they should not be given the opportu-
nity to kill the antagonist before the ﬁ-
nale. Instead, a clever antagonist sends 
minions against a well-armed group, 
to wear them down and make them 
less of an opponent when the show-
down inevitably occurs.
Locations can also be antagonists, 
if they are the source of the character’s 
obstacles. A challenging environment 
such as a desert or an ice ﬂoe can be as 
deadly as a dragon even for hardy ad-
venturer-types. Alternatively ﬁnding a 
long-lost Roman fort, or the location 
of a mythical island, can provide chal-
lenges for all sorts of grog characters.
CLUES
With all-grog groups, there is no 
need to worry about magi plucking an-
swers from another’s mind, or bringing 
other varieties of “plot-solving” magics 
to bear. Instead, a grog group is going 
to be far more reliant on their Char-
acteristics and Abilities to pick up on 
clues, and this stresses the importance 
of a varied group of characters for 
grog-only adventures (see “Picking 
Your Team,” Chapter 4).
A good piece of advice that ap-
plies particularly to mystery stories, 
but also to stories in general — make 
sure that there are at least three ways 
in which the characters can obtain 
any vital piece of information. It is 
too easy to stump players if they miss 
a clue, and with two back-ups, the 
chances are good that they will not 
miss it altogether. Make sure there 
are plenty of different ways of getting 
the information. It is too easy to allow 
Awareness to become a “Find Clue” 
Ability. Perception can be combined 
with other Abilities equally easily: 
with Folk Ken to spot lies; with Liv-
ing Language to pick up the traces of 
an odd accent; and with Ride to spot 
which horse has been lathered from a 
long ride. Information can be gained 
directly from storyguide characters 
by using various Social Abilities, from 
the character’s own learning, or from 
hunches supplied by Supernatural 
Abilities such as Premonitions.
OBSTACLES
Clues advance a plot, whereas ob-
stacles hinder it. This catch-all cat-
egory consists of all the barriers that 
the characters must overcome. These 
might be literal obstacles in the form 
of a mountain to be scaled, a river to be 
crossed, or a fortress to be breached, 
or metaphorical barriers such as earn-
ing the trust of the village, or ﬁnding 
the right person to bribe. In general, 
obstacles should become greater chal-
lenges to the characters as the story 
approaches its climax.
The End
Stories can end in one of two ways: 
a happy ending or a disastrous ending 
— the original meanings of comedy 
and tragedy, respectively. Some stories 
are speciﬁcally intended to end well or 
end poorly, regardless of the actions 
of the grog characters. This may seem 
harsh, but if used sparingly, it rein-
forces the idea that grogs are support 
characters, rather than the main cast.
THE SHOWDOWN
The ﬁnal showdown is what all the 
preceding parts of the story have been 
leading to. In many situations, this 
is where they ﬁnally confront their 
antagonist despite his best efforts to 
avoid them, and they must now over-
come him to win the day. A cunning 
antagonist chooses the location for 
the ﬁnal showdown, and ensures that 
everything is in his favor; wise charac-
ters attempt to do the same. The result 
is usually a compromise between both 
sides’ favored location, and allows the 
storyguide to tune the ﬁnal showdown 
according to how well that charac-
ters have performed until that point. 
For example, if they have failed to 
uncover the dragon’s weak spot, then 
they might be given the upper hand 
in picking the location of the ﬁnale, 
allowing them to prepare the ground 
with traps and snares that even the 
score somewhat.
MAGUS EX MACHINA
Sometimes, a story will end with 
the magi sweeping in and saving the 
day. This might have been the point 
of the adventure — the grogs do all 
the hard work setting up the ﬁnale to 
give the magi the best chance of suc-
cess — or it may be entirely acciden-
tal or unexpected. This sort of end is a 
manner by which a happy ending can 
be almost guaranteed, regardless of 
how poorly the grog characters have 
done, but it also robs them of a sense 
of achievement, and so should be used 
rarely, unless the players really enjoy 
being the ones to ride to the rescue 
when all seemed lost.
ROCKS FALL, EVERYONE DIES
An extreme form of tragedy, in 
this resolution, all the grogs die at the 
end of the adventure. Perhaps they 
have been sent up against a hopelessly 
powerful opponent, or maybe it was 
always a suicide mission. When the 
grogs fail to return, the magi and com-
panions may be sufﬁciently motivated 
to investigate themselves.
This end to an adventure generates

Grogs
a lot of pathos, and can be a shock-
ing and unexpected end to a story. It 
is certainly not a tactic that should be 
overused, and it is a brave storyguide 
who uses it against a group of favored 
grogs. However, this ending is an ex-
cellent way to enforce the idea that the 
life of a grog can be brutal and short.
REWARDS
Grogs earn experience points at 
the same rate as any other character, 
but rarely beneﬁt from other rewards 
of stories such as vis, hidden knowl-
edge, or magical items. A slap on the 
back and a “well done” from a magus 
is little reward for putting one’s life 
on the line, and the storyguide should 
consider other less traditional forms 
of reward. For a start, grogs who are 
successful gradually come to be rec-
ognized as dependable, competent, 
and even heroic, both at the covenant 
and further aﬁeld. When a mission is 
successfully completed, a grog char-
acter should earn experience points in 
a Reputation (ArM5, page 167) that 
represents the recognition of a task 
well done by the magi. This Repu-
tation should serve as a reﬂection of 
the status of the character within the 
covenfolk, and may translate directly 
into better quarters, higher wages or 
pension, or a position of responsibil-
ity. As the score in this Reputation 
rises, the character becomes a local ce-
lebrity, as grogs gossip about his deeds 
to non-covenfolk. Related to fame and 
fortune gained through Reputation 
are less tangible rewards, such as the 
grace and favor of important locals or 
supernatural entities. A grog character 
might be able to call in favors, receive 
one-off mentoring, or develop an 
agency among the wider world (Houses 
of Hermes: Societates, page 140).
Another form of reward is per-
sonalized equipment. A grog can 
ﬁnd unique weapons, armor, or other 
kinds of equipment while adventur-
ing, or else be rewarded with them as 
a mark of the magi’s favor. This equip-
ment might be simply unusual, or it 
might be exceptionally well-crafted, 
or even magical. City & Guild, page 69, 
has some simple rules for the game ef-
fects of particularly well-made pieces 
of equipment.
All-Grog 
Sagas
Troupes may be hesitant at run-
ning sagas that only involve grogs, 
since the main focus of Ars Magica 
Fifth Edition is the Order of Hermes 
and the magic it practices. However, 
Mythic Europe is interesting enough 
on its own without having to involve 
the Order. The interplay between su-
pernatural powers and mundane his-
tory is a compelling one, and some 
troupes are overwhelmed by the 
complexities of Hermetic magic or 
politics, or are simply more interested 
in history than fantasy. This section 
has ideas to suit such palates. You 
will note that the Order of Hermes 
is not entirely absent from many of 
these saga ideas. This is only to be ex-
pected; the Order is as much a part of 
Mythic Europe as the Church, the no-
bility, and the freemen and peasants. 
However, it is not intended in these 
saga ideas that the players have ma-
gus characters; instead, the magi are 
storyguide characters with whom the 
player characters interact.
The ideas presented here need not 
be exclusive of more traditional game 
play. Two sagas could easily be run 
simultaneously, perhaps using alterna-
tive storyguides as described earlier. 
One saga deals with the actions of the 
magi, the other the consequences that 
those actions have on the turb, the 
nearby town, village, or monastery, or 
so forth. Likewise, the reactions of the 
grog part of the saga may have reper-
cussions on the magi, and so on, back 
and forth between the two story lines.
A Town Saga
Towns and cities need not sim-
ply be places that the characters pass 
through on the way to somewhere 
A Town-based Saga: Toulouse
In the Languedoc region of 
France, Toulouse is famous (or per-
haps infamous) for its liberal attitudes 
and its love of art, both in its per-
forming and productive forms. The 
Languedoc region is known to be the 
home to the heretical Albigensian (or 
Cathar) sect, and it is rumored that 
Toulouse is steeped in their beliefs 
and its residents have abandoned 
the Church in droves. The pope 
has responded by creating the Friars 
Preacher — the Order of St. Domi-
nic — who are speciﬁcally trained to 
debate theology and counter heresy. 
Should the Dominicans discover that 
Catharism is prominent at all levels 
of society in Languedoc, it is likely 
that the pope will order a crusade 
against the region.
Quite apart from the religious 
pressure, there are also political is-
sues in the region. The eastern re-
gion of the Languedoc, around Nar-
bonne and Perpignan, is claimed by 
the King of Aragon and Catalonia. 
The area directly to the northwest 
of Languedoc is owned by the King 
of England. Both royal houses have 
designs on the region, and with the 
Count of Toulouse showing signs 
of dissatisfaction with the King of 
France, it promises to be an interest-
ing few decades for the region.

interesting. They can be hotbeds of 
political intrigue, bastions of civiliza-
tion in a sea of wilderness, places to 
see exotic visitors from distant lands, 
and even the battlegrounds for the 
hearts of men. Just because a town is a 
bastion of humanity and the native en-
vironment of the Dominion aura, this 
does not mean that there is no place 
for the supernatural. Household faer-
ies are rarely bothered by the Domin-
ion, and magical creatures can lurk in 
isolated pockets aligned to the Magic 
realm. At night, when the Dominion 
aura declines and the Infernal aura ris-
es, demons can come out to tempt the 
souls of mankind.
Characters who are permanently 
resident in towns are likely to have 
been trained in a particular profes-
sion, even if they do not currently 
follow that trade. In bigger cities, 
craftsmen are likely to be members 
of a guild, and the politicking among 
guilds for greater prominence in the 
city’s affairs could be a source of 
many stories. Characters could also 
be members of the clergy, part of the 
town’s administration staff, promi-
nent ﬁgures in the watch, or employ-
ees of the local lord.
City & Guild is an excellent resource 
for a saga based in a town. It has sev-
eral featured towns, details of regular 
fairs, concepts for craftsmen and mer-
chant characters, and many story ideas 
based around cities.
An Academic Saga
The 13th century is the age of 
the university: there are currently 
ten universities in Italy, Spain, France 
and England, and this number is set 
to greatly expand over the coming 
years. Some universities are hotbeds 
of heresy, others enjoy freedom from 
temporal authority, and at least one 
harbors a secret tradition of hedge 
wizards (see Hedge Magic Revised Edi-
tion, page 96).
Characters might be students, 
masters of the school, or members of 
its associated staff. A student character 
might be a simple student still study-
ing for his ﬁrst degree; a baccalaureus 
who has passed his exams; a master-
student studying for his magisterial 
degree; or a specialist student who is 
working toward his doctorate. The 
masters must have achieved at least 
the magister in artibus degree, and are 
probably doctors of their faculty. In 
addition to these two obvious roles, 
universities also have places for non-
academically inclined characters, em-
ployed either by the faculties or the 
student nations; such roles include the 
lupus, who imposes discipline on the 
students; the messengers, employed 
to run messages to the students’ fami-
lies; and the beadles, who arrange 
the ceremonial duties of the univer-
sity. Furthermore, universities require 
many of the same gamut of servants 
and specialists as any other institu-
tion — cooks, scullions, bookbinders, 
ink-grinders, parchment-makers, and 
so forth.
Art & Academe has plenty of advice 
for running sagas which concentrate 
on life at a university or school, from 
earning a place at university to sitting 
exams, and the daily life of both stu-
dents and masters.

Grogs
A Monastic Saga
While monks are supposed to be 
cloistered away from the rest of hu-
manity and spend their lives in con-
templation of God, many monasteries 
are either inside or near to towns, and 
cannot help but be involved in local 
politics. Monasteries are seen as a 
place of learning and rationality, and 
are often asked to mediate disputes, 
offer advice on spiritual and secu-
lar matters, and provide protection 
against the unknown and supernatural. 
Because of the dedication of their lives 
to God, monks may ﬁnd themselves 
the speciﬁc target of demons, and the 
corruption of a monastic order is a 
joy for the Infernal powers to behold; 
if the populace can see that not even 
monks can stay pure, what hope does 
the common man have?
Mythic Europe has a number of 
different types of regular clergy (that 
is, those who live according to a rule). 
Monks are contemplative, living 
separated from the mundanities of 
the world to attain purity of thought 
and action. 
Friars are active; their principle 
role is to go out among the commu-
nity and do good works. They dis-
tribute food to the poor, tend to the 
sick, and bring the Word of God to 
the common man. 
The third basic type of regular 
clergy are the canons, who are suppli-
cative. Canons staff cathedrals, mak-
ing the sacred space a ﬁt place to wor-
ship God, and providing the choir as 
well as altar attendants. 
In addition to these three basic 
types, there are two other important 
sectors of regular clergy: nuns (who are 
in effect female monks or, much more 
rarely, friars), and the militant orders 
(of which the Hospitallers, Templars, 
Teutonic Knights, and Order of San-
tiago are the principle ones).
Once you have decided the type 
of clergy that your saga is going to 
feature, you should create grog char-
acters to ﬁt. Unlike the other saga 
concepts mentioned in this chapter, 
most of the grog characters in a mo-
An Academic Saga: The Hidden Coven
The player characters are grogs 
who hold inﬂuential positions at 
a university, probably one of the 
larger institutions like those at Paris 
or Bologna. While contending with 
the usual challenges of academic 
life — heresy, rowdy students, an-
tagonism of the locals, and so forth 
— they also become gradually 
aware of an insidious secret society 
among the masters and students of 
the school. It becomes clear that 
this cabal is attempting to discover 
some dark mystery hidden in the 
bowels of the university, and that 
the player characters must race to 
discover it ﬁrst.
The nature of the secret society 
is up to the storyguide. It could be 
a cult of diabolists trying to uncov-
er some rite to raise a demon, or a 
group of churchmen trying to keep 
the very same hidden. The society 
might consist of faeries, or even a 
hidden covenant of magi. When 
the players discover the secret, they 
may have to re-evaluate their pre-
conceptions about their antagonists, 
and may even ﬁnd themselves work-
ing with them.
A Monastic Saga: The Priory of St. Nerius
Nerius is often considered to 
be the patron saint of the Order of 
Hermes although he has not yet been 
canonized. His story can be found in 
Realms of Power: The Divine, page 91, 
and the Holy Societas of magi that 
follow him are described on page 
94 of the same source. The Neri-
usians have a decidedly unorthodox 
approach to the liturgy that might 
cause friction with the clergy, should 
they be discovered. Naturally, they 
teach that magic and morality need 
not be incompatible, but there is a 
need to contemplate the nature and 
purpose of the spells one casts. Neri-
usians promote tolerance for magical 
beasts and faeries, which they main-
tain have a rational soul, and teach 
that the Faerie Realm is the Garden 
of Eden where humanity was born.
So far, the followers of St. Ner-
ius have been guided by a modiﬁed 
Benedictine rule, but they are begin-
ning to switch to a Franciscan model, 
allowing them to travel and dwell 
among other magi. Combined with 
this shift in praxis, the Neriusians 
might also accept non-magi into 
their ranks. The message of St. Ner-
ius is too important to be conﬁned 
to just magi, and if unGifted brothers 
can bring his word to mundane com-
munities, there is a greater chance 
of the acceptance of the Order as 
a whole. The player characters are 
grogs who are missionaries for the 
Priory of St. Nerius, trying to con-
vince people that magi are not evil, 
and convince magi that the Domin-
ion need not be antithetical to mag-
ic. Naturally, it requires brave and in-
trepid souls to walk into a covenant 
and start preaching! In a Neriusian 
saga, the grog characters may be a 
little unusual; they are likely to have 
Supernatural Abilities or powers tied 
to the Divine Realm, and may be ac-
companied or mentored by a magus 
or companion character who is also 
a Neriusian.

Grogs
nastic saga will have the same Social 
Status, and be relatively unspecial-
ized in their skill sets. This means 
that the players have to work harder 
to distinguish their characters from 
one another, using interesting back-
grounds before the character took 
the tonsure, and through Personality 
Flaws or Traits to represent particular 
strengths or weaknesses in the char-
acter’s virtue. 
It is quite possible that among the 
various orders there are several mem-
bers of Holy Traditions, such as As-
cetics or Cantores (Realms of Power: The 
Divine, pages 47 and 93, respectively), 
and True Faith might be more preva-
lent; the assumption of these powers 
represents a possible means for the 
characters to become transformed 
into companion characters (see Chap-
ter 5).

ies and convents can be found in The

A Mercenary Saga
“Satan’s minions, ministers of the devil…
murderers, blooded with human slaughter, 
night-prowlers, arsonists, the sons of Belial.” 
— Matthew Paris, describing 
the mercenaries of King 
John of England
The 13th century is the time that 
mercenaries really come into their 
own, although they will gain promi-
nence — some would say dominance 
— over the next couple of centuries. 
Commonly known as routiers, merce-
nary soldiers are of humble origin and 
yet form a warrior-elite; as they cross 
the social divide preserved by the no-
bility, mercenaries are pariahs and cast 
in the worst possible light.
The supply of mercenaries can be 
an income stream for a covenant that 
does not mind skirting the Code of 
Hermes, and a company supported 
by covert Hermetic magic can quickly 
become a force to be reckoned with, 
and, what’s more, highly sought after. 
Mercenaries in medieval Europe often 
traveled great distances to make war in 
the service of their employers, and a 
mercenary saga is a good opportunity 
for characters to visit exotic locales far 
from their homeland. They may ﬁnd 
themselves taking part in the recon-
quista of al-Andalus, ﬁghting pagans 
around the Baltic coast, or becoming 
embroiled in the Crusades.
In sagas focused around a merce-
nary theme, the most common sort of 
character is naturally a soldier. There 
are characteristic forces for many re-
Military Units in the 13th Century
The following describes some 
typical military units and mercenary 
companies in Mythic Europe. Mer-
cenary units are often referred to by 
their nationality, as if they were a 
single organized force. Occasionally 
this is true, and a count or duke hires 
out his countrymen to nations; more 
usually there are a number of indi-
vidual bands, each with their own 
company leader.
Aragonese and Navarrese: Two 
groups of mercenaries deriving 
from the Iberian peninsula, the 
Aragonese and Navarrese are 
light cavalry.
Biscayans: The Biscayans (also called 
Basques) hail from the Pyrenees 
between France and Spain, and 
are skirmish units specialized in 
the use of slings.
Brabançons: A notoriously brutal 
band of mercenaries from Flan-
ders, the Brabançons are mostly 
heavy infantry. They are known 
for looting and brigandage, and 
have even massacred entire towns 
in an attempt to get ransom mon-
ey. See The Lion and the Lily, page 
77, for more details.
Capuchonnés: Originally a civil 
defense force raised in direct 
response to the pillaging of the 
Brabançons, 
the 
Capuchon-
nés of Aquitaine, Gascony, 
Languedoc, and Provence have 
become a mercenary force in 
their own right, in distinctive 
white capes with pointed hoods. 
See The Lion and the Lily, page 77, 
for more details.
Coterells: French infantry units 
named after the broad-bladed 
knives that they carry; principally 
Poitevins and Gascons.
Flemish Geldon: A famed merce-
nary force that employs long 
spears in densely-packed forma-
tion to foil the charges of heavy 
cavalry, and provide cover for 
javeliners.
Genoese Crossbowmen (balestrieri 
genovesi): Trained and organized 
in Genoa and armed by one of its 
professional guilds, the balestrieri 
not only defend Liguria, but are 
also hired out to armies across 
Mythic Europe for both land and 
naval battles. Each crossbowman 
is accompanied by a groom who 
holds up a large shield while the 
crossbow is being reloaded.
German Falchonners: From the 
Holy Roman Empire, heavy 
cavalry and mounted heavy in-
fantry. The Holy Roman Em-
peror employs a 3,000 strong 
force of Germans as his personal 
troops. They are noted for their 
heavy slashing swords and plate 
breastplates.

Grogs
gions of Mythic Europe, but a suc-
cessful mercenary band is one that can 
offer something different to its em-
ployer, either in the form of specialist 
troops or as a mixed bag with different 
skills. Not every grog needs to be a 
soldier however; mercenary bands still 
need cooks, chirurgeons, camp-fol-
lowers, and characters who can repair 
and manufacture weapons and armor. 
They may have a permanent base, or 
be constantly wandering from place 
to place, looking for hire. If the com-
pany is of the latter sort, some thought 
should be put into the logistics of their 
operation: they probably have a bag-
gage train for the more slow-moving 
parts of their company, consisting of 
pack animals and perhaps wagons. 
They may have a set route, or else 
track down rumors of conﬂict and of-
fer themselves to either side.
A Noble Saga
A noble household is perhaps the 
closest model of a “typical” covenant, 
and a saga based around a nobleman 
and his entourage is essentially Ars 
Magica with the magi removed. Apart 
from those stories which relate direct-
A Mercenary-Based Saga: The Monjoie Company
Until 70 years ago, the Monjoie 
Company was just a normal merce-
nary band, with moderate local fame 
and a relatively steady employment. 
Then, in 1153, they were hired by a 
magus of House Guernicus, whose 
grogs had all been slain and who 
needed warriors quickly before his 
quarry escaped him. The Monjoie 
Company was successful in catch-
ing the renegade magus, and the 
satisﬁed quaesitor hired them again. 
Their fame soon spread through-
out the Order of Hermes, and the 
Monjoie Company now works ex-
clusively for Hermetic clients, and 
has grown to number more than 
150 men.
The Monjoie Company has sev-
eral contact houses covering most 
of the western tribunals. They do 
not ever learn the true names of 
their employers, but instead refer 
to their clients by the names of one 
of Charlemagne’s Twelve Paladins 
— the founder of the company, 
now dead, had a bit of a thing for 
the Song of Roland — so a magus 
might be known as Roland, Ogier, 
Ganelon, Turpin, and so forth. The 
conditions of hire imposed by the 
Company are that they are always 
accompanied by a magus, and that 
there is full disclosure on the nature 
of the mission. The local captains 
retain the right to refuse a commis-
sion, but the work is sufﬁciently 
lucrative to make this rare. They 
accept payment in coin and vis; the 
latter is traded with the venditores 
of House Verditius in exchange for 
enchanted items.
The player characters constitute 
a regional band of the company, un-
der the control of a captain. These 
bands usually number around 20 
men, and each player takes on one 
or more of the grogs. The player 
characters might ﬁnd themselves 
ﬁghting hordes of revenants with a 
Donator Requietis Aeternae (Hous-
es of Hermes: Societates, page 115), 
and then next season cornering a 
dragon with a member of House 
Tremere, followed a year later by 
tracking down diabolist magi with a 
Flambeau. It is certainly likely to be 
an action-packed saga!
A Noble Saga: A Quiet Place in the Country
A baron with an excess of chil-
dren places his third son in charge 
of one of his vills. The son gains 
a small manor house and a nearby 
village from this, and is expected 
to oversee the labors of the peas-
ants attached to the vill, and ensure 
that the various sources of income 
from the vill are gathered on time. 
What the baron didn’t tell his son is 
that the vill has a history of trouble: 
two reeves placed over the vill have 
disappeared without a trace, and 
the most recent one is now under 
the care of the local monastery, his 
mind shattered.
The player characters can run 
the baron’s son, his friends (and 
perhaps wife), as well as certain 
notables in the village, although 
these themselves are probably new 
to the manor as well. The villagers 
are harboring a terrible secret, one 
which most of the time they can 
keep under control with appropriate 
proprietary sacriﬁces, but it occa-
sionally runs free and does all sorts 
of damage. The form of this secret 
varies — it could be an imprisoned 
demon, a courtly faerie, or a lycan-
thrope. In addition to this secret, 
a village is rife with petty rivalries, 
superstition, and day-to-day prob-
lems associated with the produc-
tion of food. The characters might 
get much more involved in peasant 
life: chasing off faeries who steal 
the milk; settling arguments over a 
girl; ﬁnding lost cows; and uncover-
ing a witch. Over time, the baron’s 
son might expect to transform into a 
Companion character (see Chapter 
5), and his entourage might develop 
with him.

Grogs
ly to the internal politics of the Order 
of Hermes, most of the stories that ap-
ply to standard sagas can apply to a 
saga based around a noble household, 
but without having recourse to Her-
metic magic.
The same soldiers, servants, and 
specialists found at a covenant have a 
place in a noble household, with the 
exception of those grogs who spe-
ciﬁcally support the magical activities 
of the covenant. In a typical baron’s 
household, the baron himself — and 
perhaps his wife and a few select staff 
— are companion characters, and ev-
eryone else comprises grog charac-
ters. Even the baron’s sons who have 
reached their majority could be con-
sidered grog characters, since they 
are not yet powerful enough to attract 
Story Flaws. As a result, they would be 
suitable player characters in a grog-
only saga, particularly second and 
subsequent sons.
Lords of Men has plenty of good in-
formation and ideas for sagas based 
around a noble’s household. Rules 
for leisure time and for war are given, 
along with details of the lands owned 
by a nobleman, both those in his im-
mediate vicinity (the castle and as-
sociated lands) and in the rest of his 
demesne (including village life). Ad-
vancement of one’s reputation among 
one’s vassals and superiors is also de-
veloped in detail.
A Redcap Saga
Redcaps are the support structure 
of the Order of Hermes, and are a 
presence that is often neglected in a 
traditional saga, as simply the means 
by which news is brought to the magi. 
However, redcaps provide so much 
more than a messenger service for the 
Order. They are heralds, who store in-
formation about magi and covenants 
in a tribunal. They are bankers and 
merchants, exchanging and lending 
vis, pawning magical items, and spec-
ulating on potentially risky expedi-
tions and ventures. They can provide a 
bodyguard service for traveling magi, 
and occasionally keep trade routes 
clear of supernatural menaces. Redcaps 
are wanderers and trailblazers, extend-
A Redcap Saga: The Hermetic Agency
Taking its lead from the genres 
of spy and detective ﬁction, the 
player characters are agents of the 
Order of Hermes. They may be at-
tached to one of the Tribunal’s Mer-
cer Houses, have a dedicated head-
quarters, or work from a covenant. 
Rather than completing the usual 
tasks of redcaps, they are charged 
with a host of tasks involved with 
the interface between the Order of 
Hermes and mundane society. Their 
role could be to gather evidence 
that a magus has been meddling in 
mundane politics, to cover up such 
involvement while the Tribunal sees 
that the Code-breaker is duly pun-
ished, or else to subtly manipulate 
matters in a manner dictated by 
their superiors, so that the Order of 
Hermes cannot be held responsible 
for their actions.
The characters might work for 
an individual covenant or for the 
Tribunal as a whole, but they prob-
ably have a single contact who gives 
them their orders (this may or may 
not be a magus). A common trope in 
this sort of story is for the charac-
ters to gradually discover that they 
do not work for whom they thought 
they did. This saga does not require 
that any of the characters are nec-
essarily redcaps — it works equally 
well with standard grogs — but 
making the characters redcaps gives 
them a certain amount of authority 
in the pursuit of their investigations.

ing the knowledge and boundaries of 
the Order by pressing into unknown 
regions. Finally, in some tribunals at 
least, the redcaps are bureaucrats and 
administrators, ensuring that tribunal 
proceedings run smoothly and assist-
ing the quaesitores.
Redcap characters are companion 
characters, because the Redcap Vir-
tue (ArM5, page 48) is a Major Social 
Status Virtue and is therefore nor-
mally unavailable to grog characters. 
There are two ways to deal with this; 
either allow the Redcap Virtue as a 
free Virtue (much like Hermetic Ma-
gus is a free Virtue), so that all char-
acters may take it and beneﬁt from 
the additional experience points and 
magical items. This tends to lead to 
a slightly higher-powered campaign 
than most grog-only sagas, but since 
everyone will be equal, this should 
not interfere. Alternatively, the player 
characters work for the redcaps rather 
than being redcaps themselves; they 
might still be apprenticed to a senior 
redcap, or else serve as skilled special-
ists in another capacity.

and its non-magical members, includ-
ing various societates to which they

Ars Magica Fifth Edition is a game 
about magi ﬁrst and foremost, with 
companions also being important in 
generating and contributing to stories. 
Grogs are usually an insigniﬁcant third 
in the order of importance. This chap-
ter is concerned with getting grogs 
more involved in stories, and with 
making them more than just a bunch 
of Combat Totals.
Putting 
Together  
Your Team
A good grog captain knows that 
it is not sufﬁcient to pick your best 
warriors when heading out on an ex-
pedition with the magi. While the 
grogs might be most called-upon 
for ﬁghting, it is important to have a 
full complement of skills to best sup-
port the mission. Having the right 
team provides the grogs with roles 
in which they can be of more use to 
the magi. The liber gregis identiﬁes ﬁve 
basic roles that should be fulﬁlled 
in any group leaving the covenant. 
This is not to say that every group 
of grogs should consist of ﬁve indi-
viduals; one grog could easily possess 
the essential skills of two or more of 
these roles. Furthermore, the team 
can be supplemented with standard 
warriors who fulﬁll no special role 
within the team.
The limit to the size of any group is 
determined by the designated leader. 
An individual can only lead a band of 
grogs as a trained group equal in size 
to his score in the Leadership Abil-
ity. Another important consideration 
is the choosing of a vanguard. The 
temptation is to pick the turb’s best 
warrior, but this might exclude other 
essential members from the trained 
group, since there can be no more 
than a 5 point difference between any 
of the Combat Totals (Initiative, At-
tack, Defense, Damage, and Soak) of 
the best and the worst warriors in a 
trained group (ArM5, page 172). It is 
common practice for the drill sergeant 
of a turb to ensure that all his soldiers 
are trained to an equal level.
The names used for each of the 
ﬁve roles described later derive from 
the liber gregis; different covenants 
might have speciﬁc job titles for cer-
tain grogs, bands of grogs who are 
trained to ﬁll speciﬁc roles, or else 
have no ofﬁcial recognition of the dif-
ference, yet still choose an adventur-
ing party based on the needs of the 
magi. Some magi never even bother 
to learn the names of the grogs with 
whom they adventure, but instead 
simply use their titles.
Dux, the Leader
The leader is the individual who 
has been trained to coordinate a 
band of soldiers in combat, and an 
essential feature is a good score in 
the Leadership Ability. A leader is 
also often selected by the magi based 
on his intelligence, his loyalty, and 
his ability to speak Latin — or at 
least, have a language in common 
with most of the magi present. In ad-
dition to commanding the grogs in 
combat, the leader is often in charge 
Grogs in Stories
Chapter Four
Commanding Larger Groups
A leader can usually only have a 
number of men under his command 
equal to his Leadership score. How-
ever, larger groups can be handled 
through having the leader include 
subordinates in his command, who 
each command their own men. For 
example, a Dux with a Leadership of 
4 commands 3 soldiers and an Op-
tio. The Optio has a Leadership of 
3, and he therefore commands an-
other 3 soldiers. The effective size 
of the trained group is 8. There are 
disadvantages behind indirect com-
mand. Firstly, any Leadership rolls 
made by the overall leader to affect 
the entire group (such as those un-
der Advanced Group Combat, later) 
have Ease Factors 3 higher than nor-
mal. Secondly, issuing commands 
that affect the whole group takes up 
the leader’s whole action, although 
the subordinates can relay the com-
mands as a “free” action.

Grogs
of the day-to-day running of an ex-
pedition: coordinating the purchase 
or gathering of food; organizing the 
stops on the way; and maybe even 
planning the route. Perhaps most im-
portant is the role of liaison with the 
magi; all orders to the grex come via 
the leader.
Optio, the  
Second in Command
The optio is the right-hand man 
of the dux. His principle role is to 
ensure that the orders of the leader 
are carried out, and to assume that 
role if the leader is incapacitated or 
killed. The optio should have the 
second-best Leadership score in the 
unit. With respect to his other abili-
ties, the optio is often chosen to 
complement the abilities and skills 
of the dux. For example, if the leader 
is a superlative swordsman, then the 
optio might be a scout or an archer. 
The personality of the optio is often a 
contrast with the dux as well: a hard-
bitten disciplinarian leader is often 
coupled with a charming second who 
is much loved by the troops; likewise, 
a charming and smooth leader who 
works well with the magi often has 
a stern taskmaster as optio. His role 
is rarely combined with that of the 
vanguard except in small bands. It is 
common to combine the roles of op-
tio and signifer.
Antesignanus,  
the Vanguard
The antesignanus literally stands 
before (ante) the standard (signum), and 
is the vanguard in any group of war-
riors. Another name for this role is the 
duplicarius, referring to the tradition 
of awarding the vanguard double pay 
and rewards, due to the danger in-
herent in his role. Vanguards are not 
necessarily the best warriors, but are 
often the toughest, and Virtues such as 
Enduring Constitution, Rapid Conva-
lescence, and Tough are the mark of a 
good antesignanus.
It is generally considered a bad 
idea for the vanguard and the leader 
roles to be combined in a single indi-
vidual. Placed as he is in the forefront 
of any battle, the vanguard is the most 
likely individual to be wounded or 
killed, and if the vanguard is also the 
leader of the troop, it dissolves into an 
untrained group immediately.
Immune, the Specialist
In the Roman army, the immunes 
were a class of legionary who pos-
sessed specialized skills, which made 
them exempt from normal duties such 
as labor and patrol. The liber gregis 
recognizes the importance of special-
ists in a troop, and sensibly suggests 
Sounds Familiar?
The team structure suggested 
here is a common trope in modern 
literature and visual media, called 
the Five Man Band (the Hero, the 
Lancer, the Tough Guy, the Smart 
Guy, and the Chick). This time-
tested formula gives a spread of 
skills to a relatively small group 
of individuals. It is also a use-
ful shortcut for your players who 
might subconsciously recognize 
the trope even if they are not con-
sciously aware of it. Admittedly, 
the Five Man Band is a cliché, but 
clichés are appropriate for grogs, 
who are supposed to ﬁll a support 
role rather than be the main ﬁgures 
in the action.

Grogs
that the immune must be chosen ac-
cording to the nature of the expedi-
tion. The most common immune is 
a chirurgeon; a turb that does not 
have access to basic ﬁrst aid is in dire 
straits. However, like the Roman im-
munes, there is often a place for skills 
such as military architects, artillery-
men, weapons instructors, carpen-
ters, hunters, and trumpeters. Grogs 
with Supernatural Abilities such as 
Second Sight are usually immunes. If 
an immune does not have basic com-
bat skills, he cannot be a member of 
the trained group.
Signifer, the Legate
In the Roman legions, the signifer 
carried the signum (standard) of the 
troop, a spear bearing commemora-
tive medals of the battles they had 
fought, and topped with an open hand 
signifying the oath of the legion. It is 
the rare covenant that carries a stan-
dard on an expedition, but the signi-
fer often bears the other responsibili-
ties of his Roman predecessor, being 
responsible for the distributing the 
soldier’s pay and keeping a record of 
their savings, and maintaining morale. 
In short, the signifer takes care of the 
internal tensions of the troop, and is 
often chosen based on his social skills, 
particularly Folk Ken and Carouse. As 
a consequence, he often acts as the 
spokesman of the magi when dealing 
with mundanes. The signifer is occa-
sionally taught how to read and write, 
so that there is at least one member 
of the troop who can receive written 
orders and interpret signs. Like the 
immune, the signifer is still one of the 
covenant’s warriors, and receives basic 
training as a soldier.
Equipping  
the Grogs
Grogs are expected to be ready 
for anything, and carrying the cor-
rect equipment is the essence of good 
preparation. However, the beneﬁts 
of equipment are often downplayed 
in Ars Magica Fifth Edition — this is 
not a game in which you load up on 
dungeoneering gear, since magi are 
considered to be above such things. 
They assume, as do their players, 
that the grogs have everything they 
might need. This section discusses 
The Grog Pack
The liber gregis lists the essential 
equipment that should be carried on 
expeditions. Beorhtric demanded 
that each grog should carry in their 
pack or on their person the follow-
ing equipment:
• Five paces of hawser (stout rope)
• Flint and tinder
• A lantern and two candles
• A woolen blanket
• A leather ﬂask ﬁlled with ale, 
or two parts water and one part 
wine (another ﬂask ﬁlled only 
with wine is allowed, with the 
permission of a magus)
• Scraps of cloth and leather, and 
leather thongs, for bandaging 
wounds and repairing clothing
• A small ﬂask of oil and sharpen-
ing stones to care for weapons 
and armor
• A heavy cloak
• An entrenching tool, either a mat-
tock or a shovel (for digging la-
trine pits or burying the vanguard)
• Strong thread and a bodkin for 
making repairs
• A leather cup, a metal bowl, and a 
skewer for eating
• A quantity of food (consisting 
of hard baked biscuits, cheese, 
dried salted ﬁsh or meat, ﬂour 
meal), sufﬁcient to support the 
grog for the number of days or-
dered by a magus
Any other equipment that the 
grog or a magus deems necessary 
for applying the other skills that 
the grog possesses must also be in-
cluded. Any personal acquisitions 
must be transported in the grog’s 
own pouches.
Furthermore, distributed among 
the grogs in the group are:
• Waterskins, food, eating uten-
sils, woolen blankets, and leath-
er tarps for tents for use by all 
magi present 
• Several empty sacks and pouches
• One set of pots and pans for 
cooking
• Two grappling hooks
• Two lanterns and three ﬂasks of 
oil
• Ten paces of thin rope
• A saw and axe for preparation of 
ﬁrewood
The gear that each grog carries 
must be arranged so that a large ma-
jority of the load can be dropped 
at a moment’s notice in emergency 
situations. The classic manner is to 
suspend the pack from the tines of a 
forked pole carried on one shoulder. 
For long expeditions, pack-grogs or 
animals should be considered.
If the covenant follows the rec-
ommendations of the liber gregis, 
then each grog pack imposes a Load 
of 4. However, this load need not 
be taken into account for most situ-
ations like combat, since it can be 
discarded without using the grog’s 
action in a round.

Grogs
the use of such equipment, and ex-
pands on the concepts of Load, Bur-
den, and Encumbrance.
Equipment Bonuses
Grogs often carry equipment to as-
sist in the execution of their tasks. This 
optional rule permits certain pieces of 
equipment to make these tasks easier. 
Equipment can offer a reduction in the 
Ease Factor for a given Ability roll, but 
only if that equipment is not essential 
to perform the task. For example, a 
craftsman does not gain an equipment 
bonus to his Craft: Wrought Iron from 
using a hammer or anvil, and a crook 
cannot use Legerdemain to operate a 
lock without using the various picks 
and levers of his trade. However, vir-
tually any sort of climbing is easier if 
a rope is at hand. Usually, no piece 
of equipment can assist in all uses of 
a single Ability, but equipment can 
often provide a bonus in a specialty. 
When a character uses equipment, the 
storyguide should determine whether 
it offers minor or major assistance. 
Minor assistance subtracts 1 from the 
Ease Factor, whereas major assistance 
subtracts 3. Only one equipment bo-
nus can be gained for each roll. The 
following table gives some examples 
of equipment bonuses (in order of 
Ability). Naturally, the storyguide 
should equally impose a minor or ma-
jor penalty to the Ease Factor for us-
ing substandard, shoddy, or damaged 
equipment. 
MINOR EQUIPMENT BONUS:  
–1 to Ease Factor
MAJOR EQUIPMENT BONUS:  
–3 to Ease Factor
Encumbrance and Load
The Encumbrance system of Ars 
Magica Fifth Edition (page 178) is 
purposefully abstract, but it can be 
used to approximate weight. Broadly 
speaking, 1 point of Load equates to 
7 pounds of weight. However, un-
wieldy or unbalanced objects might 
have a Load one point higher than 
their weight might suggest — a good 
example of this is the long spear 
(ArM5, page 176). Based on this 
measurement, a 100-pound human is 
equivalent to a Load of 15, or a Bur-
den of 5.
The maximum practical weight a 
character can carry is that Load that 
inﬂicts an Encumbrance of –5, which 
is equivalent to a Burden of (Strength 
+ 5). This is the weight that a char-
acter can lift over his head. A charac-
ter can lift a Burden of (Strength + 7) 
off the ground, and can push or drag 
a Burden of (Strength + 12). See the 
nearby insert for an expanded Encum-
brance table. Using a pulley to assist 
in lifting a load adds 3 to the charac-
ter’s effective Strength. Using a lever 
to assist in pushing a load also adds 3 
to the character’s effective Strength. 
If more than one character shoulders 
a load, then combine the weight that 
each can carry alone. 
Exempli gratia: Paul the grog has a 
Strength of +2. He can carry a maximum 
weight equal to a Load of 28 (Burden 7); 
this translates to approximately 196 pounds. 
He can lift 315 pounds off the ground (Bur-
den 9), and drag 735 pounds (Burden 14). 
The story demands that the characters push 
a stone block aside. The storyguide judges 
Encumbrance and Ability Use
Encumbrance should penalize 
most physical activities, such as run-
ning, jumping, hiding, and moving 
silently. Encumbrance also subtracts 
from any fatigue rolls. However, 
under certain circumstances, a heav-
ily encumbered character should be 
at an even greater disadvantage — 
particularly for climbing, swimming, 
and balancing. In such situations, use 
Burden rather than Encumbrance as 
a penalty to Ability rolls, to repre-
sent the additional penalty imposed 
by carrying a lot of extra kit.

ram, and therefore weighs over 4100 pounds 
(see Insert). It will take six grogs as strong 
as Paul to shift the stone block. If they each 
had a crowbar, then it would only take four 
of them.
All four-footed beasts increase 
their Strength by half again for the 
purpose of determining Encumbrance 
and weight. Note that pack animals 
and horses usually have Strength 
scores beyond the normal human 
range: a courser has a Strength of +4, 
and a destrier has a Strength of +6 (see 
Realms of Power: Magic, page 142, or the 
Book of Beasts, freely available from 
Atlas Games’ website). A destrier can 
therefore take its rider (Load 21), his 
armor (Load 6), his lance, mace, and 
heater shield (Load 7), and a full grog 
pack (Load 4), and still be unencum-
bered (Burden 8, effective Strength 9).

Roles in 
Stories
This section describes a number of 
ways in which grogs can be involved 
more in stories. It is divided into sections 
that describe the duties a grog might 
be asked to perform for his masters. 
Each section has story elements rather 
than story seeds; these are fragments of 
stories, rather than seeds in their own 
right. By focusing on some of the mi-
nor day-to-day hazards and annoyances 
posed to the grogs on an expedition, 
you can highlight some of the issues of 
the Middle Ages, and provide a richer 
roleplaying experience. However, be 
careful not to detract too greatly from 
the point of the expedition, and don’t 
get sidetracked by these issues if you are 
building tension in your storyline.

Grogs
in a day, each lasting three hours. 
Each duty watch is usually shared 
between one or two men, and they 
spend one watch on duty, followed by 
three watches off duty or free. When 
on expedition, there is no distinction 
between day patrol and night patrol; 
when not on duty, grogs are expected 
to sleep if it is nighttime, or be off 
duty during the daytime.
The usual pattern of the day is that 
the troop is on the road by the begin-
ning of the forenoon watch, although 
occasionally the magus orders an early 
start, which means the camp is roused 
at the start of the morntide watch, and 
leaves soon thereafter. A group travels 
for about nine hours; at the end of the 
foredusk watch, the dux usually orders 
a stop, although if a town, inn, or vil-
lage is within reach, they may push 
on for a couple more hours. Grogs 
are expected to bunk down before the 
nighttide watch.
The dux is in charge of determin-
ing watch rotations and sentry duty. 
Sentries are usually only placed when 
an expeditionary party is station-
ary; when on the road, all grogs are 
expected to be in a constant state of 
alertness. However, if traveling on 
horseback or with wagons, the usual 
watch rotation can be maintained; sol-
diers quickly learn to nap whenever 
they can, and can even do so while in 
the saddle.
The dux or his optio keeps track of 
the passing of the watches neverthe-
less, so it is clear whose turn it is to 
take sentry duty when the group stops 
for the night. Dodging sentry duty is 
a popular pastime among grogs, and 
they come up with inventive reasons 
why they should be exempt, or why it 
is not their turn.
Guards
Providing protection from the var-
ious natural and supernatural hazards 
of Mythic Europe is the stock in trade 
of a covenant’s grogs. By their very 
nature, magi tend to get themselves 
into dangerous situations, whether it 
is from raiding a grifﬁn’s nest, being 
beset by goblins in a haunted forest, 
or from a mob of peasants armed with 
pitchforks and torches. Guards usu-
ally use the Defenders maneuver in 
combat (ArM5, page 173, or else the 
optional rule for Defenders as Inter-
ceptor in Lords of Men, page 122) until 
their masters are safe from harm, after 
which time they can switch to more 
offensive maneuvers.
However, guard duty need not be 
as simple as acting as a meat shield in 
combat. Magi tend to be less physi-
cally able than most grogs, and not 
Story Elements: Sentry Duty
It may seem like a cliché, but 
nighttime is the best time to spring 
an ambush on a group of characters. 
The attackers hope that most of 
their opponents will be asleep, and 
that the sentries can be bypassed 
or taken by surprise. Distracting 
a bored sentry with seemingly in-
nocuous sounds or sights presents 
an opportunity for the grog to make 
Personality Trait rolls (see later) — 
does he err on the side of caution 
and wake the magi despite the po-
tential punishment that will follow, 
or does he allow his curiosity to 
get the better of him? Sentry duty 
in faerie auras can be particularly 
distracting; satyrs might entice him 
into a drinking match, or nymphs 
might try to seduce him. Or perhaps 
it was all a dream...
Sentry duty can be especially 
important when dealing with intel-
ligent and magical opponents. If 
a wizard knows he has interlopers 
in his woods, he can eavesdrop on 
their conversations and learn the 
names of the magi. Once the troop 
has moved on, he then has simply to 
search the campsite (or the latrine) 
for an Arcane Connection, and he 
has a pretty hefty Penetration Total 
against that magus. Alert sentries 
tend to discourage this behavior by 
chasing off those who might lurk at 
the fringes of a campsite.

Grogs
all are capable of using magic to com-
pensate for their lack. Consequen-
tially, relatively easy tasks — jump-
ing over pits, climbing trees, fording 
rivers, and even riding horses — tend 
to pose more of a challenge to them. 
It is the grogs’ duty to bring their 
masters home alive, and this includes 
preventing them from falling down 
cliffs, drowning, or being crushed un-
der an avalanche.
Grogs must therefore often come 
up with novel solutions to compensate 
for their masters’ physical ineptitude. 
It is the principal reason why rope 
takes up a substantial weight in the 
grog pack (see earlier), because it can 
be used in a number of ways. Rope 
makes climbing easier (and more im-
portantly, falling less likely), and can 
also be used to prevent characters 
from being swept away when crossing 
swiftly ﬂowing rivers.
Camp Duties
When on an expedition, grogs and 
their masters may need to spend many 
or most of their nights sleeping under 
the stars. This may be because the magi 
wish to avoid the attention of towns, or 
because they have been unable to se-
cure a place to stay, thanks to The Gift. 
It may be simply that the expeditions 
take them deep into the wilderness.
When not on sentry duty, grogs 
are assigned a number of tasks around 
camp. The ﬁrst order of business is 
always preparing tents for the magi. 
An area must be located — preferably 
among young trees — and cleared of 
vegetation. If the camp is simply an 
overnight stop, then these tents tend 
to be simple bivouacs designed to keep 
off the worst of the weather, made by 
slinging a tarpaulin over a rope strung 
between two trees, and securing the 
four corners off the ground. Where 
there are not enough trees, a corner-
bivouac can be constructed by attach-
ing the rope to a tree and the ground, 
and covering it with a tarp. Fresh-cut 
vegetation keeps the mud off the ﬂoor, 
and a bed of springy boughs with a 
blanket covering them is sufﬁcient. If 
rain is expected, then a channel is dug 
around the tent to divert the runoff. 
For longer stops, the grex usually car-
ries proper tents with sides to keep 
out the wind. Carrying tent poles is 
very unusual; suitable staves are pro-
Story Elements: Guards
A broken landscape, with slabs 
of rock crushed and ﬂung into weird 
angles by geology or mystical forces, 
is perhaps the biggest impediment 
to movement, and one where grogs 
really come into their own. Cross-
ing such a landscape requires a great 
deal of skill: leaping chasms, climb-
ing rock faces, and dodging falling 
rock. Fatigue rolls need to be made 
at regular intervals. This might be 
ﬁne for soldiers who have Athletics 
around 3 or so, but less able charac-
ters need a lot of help.
Underwater adventures are an-
other example of where grogs can 
come into their own. Improvising 
spells that allow free movement un-
der water is even harder than those 
to help one climb or balance, and 
so if the only way in to the Cave of 
Wonders is an underwater entrance, 
the magus will have to rely on his 
grogs to get him safely inside.
Combat situations can be made 
more challenging if combined with 
environmental hazards. As well as 
increasing the number of botch 
dice, hazards such as narrow cliff-
side paths, steam geysers, swamps, 
crevasses, and so forth can require 
characters to make rolls (usually 
Dexterity + Athletics) each round to 
avoid whatever dangers they pose.
Trail Food
The following is typical of what 
grogs eat when away from home. 
Most of the ingredients are brought 
with them or gathered from the 
wild. Any leftovers are eaten for 
lunch on the next day.
Bacon: Smoked and dried, often 
very fatty. Used in stews.
Baked Eggs: Eggs from domestic 
fowl or hedgerow birds; pierced 
and baked in embers.
Camp Stew: Dried meat boiled in 
ale with leeks and whatever veg-
etables have been brought or 
found. Thickened with ﬂour or 
stale bread.
Chiches: Dried chickpeas roasted in 
the embers, then stewed.
Eels: Caught overnight in a submerged 
bag with the mouth propped open; 
eaten smoked for breakfast. 
Girdle Bread: Flour and water mixed 
into dough, cooked on hot rocks 
or twisted around a skewer.
Gruel: Oats and water as a thin 
porridge. Only eaten when sup-
plies are low; the oats are usually 
those brought for the horses.
Hedgehog: Thickly encased in clay 
and baked in the embers; the 
spines remain in the clay ball 
when opened.
Pease Pudding: Dried peas cooked 
until thick. Often eaten cold 
next day.
Stewed Fruit: Berries and hard fruit 
are hardly ever eaten raw.
Waufres: Flour, eggs, and cheese, 
mixed together and fried as 
cakes. For a rare treat, drizzled 
with honey.
Wortes: All manner of green veg-
etables, herbs, and leeks.

Grogs
vided by nature. The grogs usually 
sleep uncovered, unless the weather is 
inappropriate, in which case a tent is 
erected to house them all.
While some grogs are seeing to 
the tents, others are preparing a ﬁre: 
gathering tinder, ﬁrewood, and curb 
stones. Suitable branches to support 
a cook-pot are trimmed, and water is 
usually put on to boil. All grogs take a 
turn at cooking, and most can produce 
a basic meal. Characters with the Sur-
vival Ability know which plants yield 
nutritious food, and gather wild veg-
etables, herbs, nuts, and fruit through-
out the day to eat during the evening 
meal. Characters with the Hunt Ability 
might obtain fresh meat, but to avoid 
being caught for poaching, they usually 
just set snares for birds or small game.
If the camp is to persist longer than 
a single night, grogs are set to digging 
latrine pits, and constructing tripod 
frames to support washing bowls, 
spits, and other camp furniture.
Guides and Messengers
Magi are much less likely to be 
aware of local geography, roads, and 
settlements than their grogs. As a con-
sequence, the planning of journeys is 
often left to grogs; the magus simply 
announces where he wants to be and 
when, and the grogs do the rest of 
the work. Long distance travel typi-
cally focuses around itineraries, or an 
ordered lists of towns to visit. At each 
town, local knowledge is called upon 
to ﬁnd the correct roads to the next 
town on the itinerary. It is important 
to learn the crossing points of rivers, 
the presence of decent roads, and the 
locations of settlements for overnight 
stops and resupplying with food in 
each locale; the itinerary might be an-
notated with such features, if the jour-
ney is expected to be repeated. Maps 
are generally too large and valuable 
to take on the road, and are generally 
only useful for planning the itinerary.
The Area Lore Ability is used for 
all sorts of navigation rolls, and is es-
sential for both planning routes and 
correctly following them. City & Guild, 
pages 82–83, provide some Ease Fac-
tors for locating signiﬁcant landmarks 
such as inns, hospices, roads, fords, 
bridges, and so forth. A character 
planning a new journey of more than 
a week can reduce the travel time by 
10% if she succeeds in an Intelligence 
+ Area Lore roll of Ease Factor 12.
Grogs are often used as messen-
gers for the magi. They may be sent 
as couriers to other covenants if the 
matter is urgent and a redcap is not 
due for a while. They may be sent 
ahead of a troop to inform their desti-
nation of their imminent arrival, or to 
arrange accommodation in a foreign 
town. Grogs might also be sent back 
home: to impart vital information to 
the covenant, to ask for reinforce-
ments, or to carry wounded comrades 
out of harm’s way.
TRAVEL SPEEDS
The table that follows indicates 
the best speeds (in miles per day) 
achievable with different modes of 
transport. Note that these are the best 
speeds: poor roads, severe weather, 
and frequent stops can substantially 
reduce these times. Furthermore, 
these are average best speed, since the 
presence of an inn or hospice might 
encourage characters to stop early 
for the day, or push on for a couple 
of hours more. Characters on foot, on 
horseback, or traveling by coach can 
fatigue themselves to travel further 
in a day; the horses are also fatigued 
by the same amount as their riders. 
Groups travel as fast as the slowest 
individual in the group.
If speed is of the essence, a char-
acter can push himself even more. A 
character on foot can cover a number 
of miles in a day equal to 15 + (2 x 
Athletics) on good roads. If he is trav-
eling cross country or through wilder-
ness, subtract 5 to 10 miles per day. 
This ﬁgure assumes that the character 
is minimally encumbered, and costs 
the character two Long-Term Fatigue 
levels, one lost halfway through the 
day and the other at dusk. As long 
as he gets a good meal and a night’s 
sleep, he can do the same on the next 
day. However, there is a limit to how 
long a character can keep up this pace; 
after a number of days equal to his 
Athletics Ability, the character only 
regains one Fatigue level each night 
Story Elements: Camping
Grogs are relatively experienced 
at setting up camps, but doing so 
in bad conditions in a hurry could 
lead to all sorts of errors. Perhaps 
the main grog tent is put on top of 
a badger sett, and they do not ap-
preciate the company. The ﬁre pit 
might attract salamanders from the 
logs, or the rushes used on the ﬂoor 
of the magus’s tent could be infested 
with ants.
Gathering food can present haz-
ards as well. Soldiers rarely pass up 
the opportunity to gather honey, but 
there is no accepted way of gathering 
this sugary treat safely. This could be 
a comical interlude, or develop into 
something more dangerous if the 
bees decide to attack in force. Trav-
eling in unfamiliar habitat could be 
dangerous; a poisonous plant could 
resemble an edible foodstuff found 
closer to the covenant, or the herbs 
could be tainted by the supernatural 
aura they have grown in.
A group of armed individuals in 
woodland might attract attention 
from nobles or their representatives, 
who assume the group are poachers 
(of course, this could easily be true).

Grogs
of sleep, so every subsequent day he 
accrues an extra Fatigue level. If the 
character is encumbered, subtract the 
Encumbrance from his Athletics Abili-
ty before calculating distance traveled.
On horseback, a character can 
cover a number of miles in a day equal 
to 30 + (2 x Ride) on good roads, 
subtracting 10 to 20 miles per day 
for cross-country or wilderness. The 
character and the horse suffer from 
Fatigue loss as described earlier. If the 
horse is encumbered, subtract its En-
cumbrance from the character’s Ride 
Ability (see Equipment, earlier, for the 
Encumbrance of horses). If a character 
lacks the Ride Ability then he is limit-
ed to 20 miles per day, and always los-
es one Long-Term Fatigue level. If the 
character is able to change horses he 
can travel faster; each change of horse 
in a day allows the character to travel 
an additional (2 x Ride) miles that day. 
However, there must be a minimal 
amount of time between changeovers 
— these speeds assume that the horses 
are ready and waiting for riders. If the 
grog has to locate and purchase a suit-
able horse, he can probably achieve 
a maximum of one change per day; if 
they are ready and waiting at the ap-
propriate locations he can manage up 
to three changes. Skilled couriers on 
horseback have sometimes managed 
to travel 90 miles in a day, by push-
ing their horses to breaking point and 
having a steady supply of fresh horses.
Boats and ships can be powered by 
sails or by oars. Sailed vessels oper-
ate in coastal waters and across seas, 
whereas rowing vessels can also navi-
gate rivers and lakes. Sailed vessels 
typically operate all day and all night. 
If traveling downstream, a rowboat 
adds the speed of the current to its to-
tal speed, which is typically three miles 
an hour. Rowers can usually manage to 
row for 10 hours each day, but if going 
downstream, the boat can also ﬂoat at 
the speed of the river when not being 
rowed, as long as someone steers it.

Story Elements: Guides and Messengers
Tension can arise between grogs 
and magi over planning a route. For 
example, the grogs might desire to 
travel south by way of an inn famous 
for its ale (or its women...); however, 
the magi may ask for the quickest 
route, which would place them at 
the tavern at lunchtime. There is no 
way that the magi will want to stop 
for the night with half the day still 
available for traveling. How long 
can the grogs delay the group with 
mishaps — a false start down the 
wrong road, a thrown shoe on one 
of the horses, a loose axle pin on the 
cart — so that they reach the inn 
conveniently close to the end of the 
day? And will the magi even notice?
Likewise, a local grog might plan 
a route which avoids the vicinity of 
the haunted lake without explaining 
why. If the magi demand that the 
group goes the shortest route, they 
might suffer rebellion or even deser-
tion, such horrors does the lake hold 
in the minds of the men.
Soldiers are often superstitious, 
and might desire to make a side 
trip to visit a local shrine, or pay 
respects at the place where a for-
mer grog is buried.
Sending grogs out to carry mes-
sages is a great way of initiating a 
grog-only story (see Chapter 3), 
or it may simply be a single event 
in a larger story. Messenger stories 
are better if small groups of grogs 
can be sent out rather than a single 
individual. Messenger stories often 
involve an element of speed. If the 
magi discover that their covenant 
or an ally is under immediate threat, 
then it might be a dash to warn 
them. A character injured on a mis-
sion might be in urgent need of a 
chirurgeon, but the best one in the 
region might be several days away. 
In such situations, even the simplest 
of obstacles — a cart with a broken 
wheel, a fallen tree, a washed-out 
bridge — can add to the dramatic 
tension of the situation.

Grogs
Representatives
One of the biggest obstacles that 
magi face is their difﬁculty in com-
municating with non-magi. The Gift 
surrounds them like a cloud, causing 
everything they say to be taken in the 
worst possible light. Their very pres-
ence engenders mistrust, which is only 
compounded by the innate suspicion 
that is often felt toward strangers. As 
a consequence, grogs can ﬁnd them-
selves at the forefront of negotiations 
with mundanes on behalf of their 
masters. Of course, this is a role often 
taken on by competent companion 
characters as well.
Bribery is an excellent way to 
loosen the tongue of a recalcitrant 
peasant; this can be overt (jingling a 
pouch of coins in front of the peas-
ant’s face) or more subtle (offering to 
buy him a few jars of ale, or buying 
some of his craft, no matter how aw-
ful it might be). When providing a 
bribe, one should keep in mind that 
only townsfolk have any great use for 
coinage — in much of rural Mythic 
Europe, barter is the main form of 
commerce. This being said, there is a 
subtle art in offering the right amount 
of bribe. If one offers too little, the 
local will be offended. If one offers 
too much, the local might become 
doubly suspicious, or even mark the 
character as a rube or future mugging 
victim. As a guide, a day laborer earns 
about one Mythic Penny per day, and 
needs the equivalent of a Mythic 
Pound every year to feed himself and 
his family. A professional earns two 
to ﬁve times as much, depending 
on trade and ability. However, most 
mundanes in Mythic Europe live 
within their means, and savings are a 
foreign concept associated with ava-
ricious behavior. A bribe equivalent 
to a day’s pay grants a Minor equip-
ment bonus (see earlier), whereas 
a bribe equivalent to a week’s pay 
grants a Major equipment bonus.
GAINING INFORMATION
The local populace often has infor-
mation that is needed for the success-
ful completion of a mission. The troop 
could spend weeks scouring the hills 
in search of the lair of a dragon and 
still not ﬁnd it, while a few words with 
a yokel could provide them with the 
information they need in minutes. Lo-
cals are often suspicious of strangers; 
this is particularly true in rural areas 
where most individuals never leave the 
village they were born in, and less true 
in cities, where new folk come in ev-
ery day. An average Communication + 
Folk Ken roll is usually sufﬁcient to get 
an individual to talk, but increase the 
Ease Factor by the local’s Suspicious 
Personality Trait.
NEGOTIATION
Grogs are often required to make 
purchases for their master, since The 
Gift results in vendors hiking their 
prices as soon as the magus approach-
es their shop or booth. Purchases 
made with currency can normally 
only be made in a town or city; some 
example prices can be found on page 
144 of City & Guild.
The Bargain Ability can be used 
to negotiate a good price for expen-
sive or bulk items. Not all items can 
be bargained for; vendors of food very 
rarely reduce their prices unless a lot 
of food is bought at once, for example. 
Bargaining usually takes place with ar-
tisans, where the true value of their 
goods is strongly associated with the 
skill of its maker or the rarity of the 
item. First, determine the actual value 
of the goods; this is usually twice the 
cost to the seller, but in cities or crises, 
inﬂation might drive the price even 
higher. The buyer can attempt to de-
termine the value by making a Percep-
tion + Bargain roll, with an Ease Fac-
tor of 9. If the goods are particularly 
common, or the buyer has a Craft or 
Profession Ability related to the goods 
to be purchased, subtract 3 from the 
Ease Factor. If the goods are especially 
rare or unusual, then add 3 or more.
Next, make a Communication + 
Bargain roll for the buyer, and one for 
the seller. The seller’s roll should be 
made in secret; if it is greater than that 
of the grog, then the seller is not pre-
pared reduce the price to less than the 
value. Otherwise, the seller will settle 
for 10% less than the value for every 
3 points or fraction that the grog’s roll 
exceeded the seller’s. Regardless of 
how good the buyer’s Bargain roll is, 
the sale price is never less than half of 
the initial value. 
Now that the storyguide knows 
how much the seller will accept, she 
can either assume that this is the price 
secured by the grog, or else roleplay 
the negotiation with the player. When 
negotiating, the seller is likely to initial-
ly ask for a price higher than the actual 
value of the goods. The seller will even-
tually go as low as the calculated price, 
but the grog doesn’t know how low 
this is, and may settle at a higher price 
instead. He may make a Perception + 
Folk Ken roll to try to detect when the 
seller is getting close to a price he is 
prepared to accept; this is opposed to 
the seller’s Presence + Guile roll.
APPRAISE VALUE OF THE GOODS:  
Perception + Bargain + simple die; 
Ease Factor 9 (usually)
BARGAIN ROLL:  
Communication + Bargain  
+ simple die for the buyer and seller
LOWEST FINAL PRICE:  
Value of goods – 10% per 3 points 
(or fraction) that the buyer’s  
Bargain roll exceeds the seller’s  
(minimum limit: 50% of value)
GAIN BARGAINING ADVANTAGE:  
Perception + Folk Ken + simple die 
of buyer versus Presence + Guile  
+ simple die of seller

PURCHASING SUPPLIES FOR TRAVEL
A perennial problem with extend-
ed travel is the lack of fresh provender. 
A village is an excellent opportunity to 
restock with long-life ingredients, and 
also to buy fresh produce that will last 
the next few days of travel. Eggs, veg-
etables (particularly leeks and onions), 
bread, butter, and grain are the most 
commonly purchased goods; meat 
is less readily available, but a village 
might be persuaded to part with its 
precious supplies of bacon and fresh 
meat for the right price. Villagers are 
more reluctant to sell produce in the 
winter and spring, when food is at a 
premium, and more likely to do so in 
the autumn.
Be aware that there is a limit to the 
amount of excess food that a village 
has. They likely have obligations to 
provide fresh produce for their lord, 
and so must reserve the greater part of 
their harvest for him. They have little 
use for coin in the short term, since 
neither they nor their lord can eat 
money. Towns are a better prospect 
for resupplying; here, there is a food 
service industry speciﬁcally tailored 
to the production of food for sale. 
With respect to prices, in a town, a 
loaf of bread costs about half a Mythic 
Penny, a chicken can be bought for 
about a Mythic Penny, as can a pound 
of cheese, two dozen eggs, ten salted 
herring, or a gallon of best ale. Broadly 
speaking, it costs a Mythic Penny to 
feed a grog for a day, if you are buying 
rather than growing his food.
ARRANGING ACCOMMODATION
While inns and church-run hos-
pices are found between major cit-
ies and along trade routes (see City & 
Guild, page 81), more isolated regions 
are devoid of such institutions, and 
travelers have to rely on the hospital-
ity of peasants. At the very least, ba-
sic Christian charity usually allows a 
group of travelers to seek shelter in a 
barn, grainstore, or chapel, and a few 
pennies might buy them a hot meal. 
Slightly more comfortable is ac-
commodation in the byre; a shelf is 
placed above the livestock so that 
people can beneﬁt from the heat 
given off by the animals. During the 
winter, the whole village might sleep 
in the communal byre above the vil-
lage’s plow-oxen. However, with magi 
around, the byre is rarely a sensible 
option; The Gift spooks animals as 
much as it does humans, and sharing a 
shed with a magus and several oxen is 
not a recipe for a quiet night.
The best accommodation on of-
fer in a village is to share a bed with a 
householder and his wife; depending 
on the number of children, they have 
there may be room for one or two ex-
tras.
To arrange a place to stay, make a 
Communication + Folk Ken roll, us-
ing the Ease Factors in the following 
table. If the peasants have had the op-
portunity to talk with the magi, then 
the social penalty of The Gift applies 
to this roll even if it is being made by 
a grog. Bribes modify this roll in the 
normal fashion.

TRANSLATION
It is not uncommon for magi to 
join a covenant in a region where 
they do not speak the vernacular lan-
guage. This may be as simple as hav-
ing difﬁculty with the local dialect, 
or as complete as no understanding 
at all. Magi rarely ﬁnd time in their 
busy schedules to learn new languag-
es — anyone important can speak 
Latin anyway, and grogs can always 


--- Page ---

55
Grogs
be used to translate. Many grogs 
learn a smattering of Latin, and some 
become quite ﬂuent. Given their op-
portunities for travel, they may also 
pick up foreign languages as well, 
and covenants occasionally employ a 
grog who is good with languages spe-
ciﬁcally for this purpose.
A character with a Language Abil-
ity of 2 or less needs to make Com-
munication + Language rolls to get 
his point across, and an Intelligence 
+ Language roll to understand what is 
said back. The Ease Factor varies ac-
cording to the level of complexity of 
the subject matter, but a 6 is normally 
sufﬁcient. Characters with Language 
Abilities of 3 or more need not make 
these rolls for everyday conversation, 
but may need to for more complex 
concepts. If the two speakers have 
more than one language in common, 
they can reduce the Ease Factor of 
communication and understanding 
by three, since they can substitute 
words in the other languages where 
they don’t know the word in the main 
language.
Unless she is ﬂuent (Language 
Ability 5 or better), use of a character’s 
social Abilities is limited by her Lan-
guage score. So a maga issuing orders 
in French (where her Ability is 3) can-
not make full use of her Leadership 4 
Ability, and must act as if she had a 
Leadership of 3. However, she could 
freely communicate her instructions 
to her grog captain, who, as a native 
French speaker, can issue her orders 
with no penalty using his own Leader-
ship Ability.
As one travels further from home, 
one encounters changes in language 
which might make conversing dif-
ﬁcult. A native speaker knows his 
own language at a score of 5, and 
may have a specialty in his own di-
alect, for an overall score of 6. He 
can sometimes communicate with a 
speaker of a different language, de-
pending on how closely related the 
two languages are:
SITUATION: Same language, different dialect
PENALTY: –1 penalty to both speakers
SITUATION: Closely related languages
PENALTY: –2 penalty to both speakers
SITUATION: Distantly-related languages
PENALTY: –3 penalty to both speakers
For example, a speaker of French 
(Norman) can talk with a native of Paris 
who speaks French (Orleanais), with a 
–1 penalty. He can talk with a native of 
Provence with a –2 penalty, since French 
and Occitan (the language of Provence) 
are closely related. He can even com-
municate basic information with speak-
ers of Castilian, at a –3 penalty.
Personality 
Traits
Personality Traits are largely a de-
scriptive statistic in Ars Magica Fifth 
Edition, used as a guide to roleplaying 
a character, rather than actually decid-
ing what they do. However, grogs of-
ten have less well-developed personal-
ities due to their role in the game, and 
they will undoubtedly act differently 
under the control of different players. 
As a consequence, the troupe may de-
cide to make greater use of Personality 
Trait rolls when determining the ac-
tions of grogs.
Each character begins with at least 
three Personality Traits that range 
from –3 to +3 (ArM5, page 33). Most 
grogs should have a Brave and a Loyal 
Personality Trait. The Loyal Trait is as-
sumed to represent their loyalty to the 
covenant, although they may develop 
different loyalties to different organi-
zations or individuals. The Loyal Trait 
is also used as a measure of the impact 
of The Gift on non-magi (see Grow-
ing Used to The Gift, later). If a char-
acter has a Personality Flaw, then she 
could be given an additional Personal-
ity Trait that matches that Flaw. This 
trait should have a value of +3 (for a 
Minor Flaw) or +6 (for a Major Flaw).
Several resources for Ars Magica 
Story Elements: Representing Magi
Using grogs as the interface be-
tween the magi and the rest of the 
world is an excellent way to get 
grogs involved in stories. A grog 
with no social Abilities is often bet-
ter than a magus with some social 
Abilities and The Gift; even if their 
effective scores are the same, the 
magus’ very presence makes people 
uncomfortable and suspicious.
If grogs are responsible for all 
social interactions, only the grogs 
are aware of the content of those 
conversations. This has several ro-
leplaying applications. If the magi 
habitually leave grogs to deal with 
mundanes, you might want to make 
a clear separation between player 
and character knowledge. If a grog 
is ordered to ask a peasant what he 
knows about the ruined castle, then 
take the player to one side and de-
liver the peasant’s rambling account 
of the legend. That player now has 
to relate the legend to the others, as 
if he were the grog reporting back. 
Any mistakes should not be cor-
rected, but the player can ask for his 
grog to make easy Intelligence rolls 
to ﬁll in details like names.
If a grog is given a pouch of 
money and asked to purchase some-
thing, he may take advantage of the 
general unworldliness of magi, and 
take a “commission” or “ﬁnder’s fee.” 
A particularly audacious manner of 
doing this is under the magus’ very 
nose, if he does not speak the lan-
guage. Let the grog’s Personality 
Traits guide this sort of behavior.

Grogs
Fifth Edition have provided lists of 
possible Personality Traits. Realms of 
Power: The Divine Revised Edition, page 
40, has an insert relating Personality 
Traits to religious virtues and vices, 
and discusses which traits oppose 
which others. Art & Academe, page 40, 
discusses the relationship between 
complexion and Personality traits, 
and provides further lists of possible 
traits linked to the preponderance of 
the humors.
Making Personality 
Trait Rolls
To decide on a character’s actions 
using Personality Trait rolls, add the 
Personality Trait to the result of a 
stress die, and compare the result to 
the table on page 19 of Ars Magica 
Fifth Edition. Pay special attention 
to the trait rolled and its sign. For ex-
ample, a character with a Cowardly 
+2 Trait who is asked to make a Brave 
roll effectively has a Brave –2 Trait. If a 
character fails a Personality Trait roll, 
then he must temporarily act in a man-
ner determined by the circumstances 
(that is, the storyguide). A character 
who lacks a Personality Trait is consid-
ered to have a score of zero. Usually, 
a single Personality Trait is applied to 
any given roll; use the most appropri-
ate, or the highest. A grog with an 
applicable Personality Flaw does not 
usually need to roll; a Major Personal-
ity Flaw takes virtually all control from 
the player under applicable circum-
stances, whereas a Minor Personality 
Flaw should determine his actions in 
lieu of a Personality Trait Roll, but not 
to the exclusion of reason.
A common experience for grogs 
is to be under the inﬂuence of con-
ﬂicting emotions. A sentry on watch 
might be tempted by his Lazy Trait 
to just go to sleep, but this is opposed 
by his Need to Please. A normally 
Brave soldier might be challenged by 
his Fear of Fire. A grog might be torn 
between his Loyal to Covenant and 
his Loyal to Friends Traits. When this 
happens, make the Personality Trait 
roll as usual, but modify the Ease Fac-
tor by the score in the opposing Trait. 
This modiﬁcation might make the 
Ease Factor harder or easier, depend-
ing on the situation.
Exempli gratia: A grog is confronted by a 
ﬁre-breathing dragon, which requires a Brave 
roll. If a magus orders him to engage the drag-
on, the character’s Loyal trait is subtracted 
from the Ease Factor, since the more loyal the 
grog is, the easier this roll is. If the character 
has a Fear of Fire, this Trait should be added 
to the Ease Factor for the Brave roll, since this 
fear discourages his natural bravery.
Growing Used  
to The Gifted
As previously explained in ArM5, 
people do not get used to The Gift. 
They can get used to a Gifted indi-
vidual, however, and regular positive 
interactions eventually allow a person 
to ignore the negative social conse-
quences generated by that character’s 
Gift. Covenants implies that it takes 
15 years for an average resident of a 
coven to ignore the social penalty of 
the Gift (see Familiarity, page 40), 
although altruism and rewards might 
shorten this substantially, and provid-
ing the grogs with better than average 
living conditions and pay can shorten 
it further still. The social penalty of a 
magus’ Gift is usually applied to any 
sort of situation roll that involves loy-
alty, but Covenants introduces the con-
cept of Prevailing Loyalty, which is 
added to any Loyal Personality Trait 
rolls instead of the magus’ social pen-
alty. Prevailing Loyalty begins as the 
average social penalty of a covenant’s 
magi, but can increase (or decrease) 
according to factors such as the length 
of time that magi and grogs have as-
sociated with one another, and the 
attitude of the magi toward the grogs 
during that time. An individual grog 
begins with a Loyal Personality Trait 
that is up to 3 points different from 
the turb’s Prevailing Loyalty.
For a more complex, but perhaps 
richer, system, each grog could have a 
separate Loyalty score for each magus 
in the covenant — or at least for those 
magi with whom he has regular con-
tact. These Loyalty scores ﬂuctuate in 
a similar manner to Prevailing Loy-
alty. Thus, if Ignatio the Shield Grog 
has regular, friendly contact with Til-
litus of Bonisagus, his initial Loyal 
+2 might develop into two Personal-
ity Traits, Loyal to Covenant +2 and 
Loyal to Tillitus +3. Consequently, 
Ignatio has an effective Loyal 0 when 
dealing with Tillitus (taking into ac-
count his –3 penalty for the Gift), 
compared to Loyal –1 with the other 
magi of the covenant.
Advanced 
Group Combat
Group Combat is an important 
concept in Ars Magica Fifth Edi-
tion, and the principle role of grogs in 
many stories. The rules in this section 
expand the Group Combat rules in 
ArM5 to add a bit more tactical depth. 
Feel free to use group combat when it 
makes sense, or have characters ﬁght 
independently whenever drama or 
troupe preference dictates. These 
rules were ﬁrst printed in Chapter 9 of 
Lords of Men.
The Leader’s Actions
A group leader can make one com-
mand-related die roll per round with-
out using his action for that round. 
The leader acts at the same point in 
the combat sequence as the rest of 


--- Page ---

57
Grogs
the group. In cases where it matters 
whether the group acts ﬁrst, or the 
leader makes the Leadership roll ﬁrst, 
the leader gets to decide the order in 
which the dice are rolled.
If the leader (or any member of the 
group, for that matter) wants to re-
main in the group, but do something 
other than attack, that’s permissible. 
Simply don’t count that individual as 
part of the group when calculating 
the group’s combat bonus or resolving 
Damage. For example, if a group of two 
grogs plus a leader is ﬁghting, and the 
leader chooses to spend his action do-
ing something else besides attacking 
(say, casting a spell), then the group’s 
combat bonus would be capped at +X 
(instead of +Y), and when the group 
hits, it only would inﬂict Damage two 
times, not three times.
Morale and Discipline
These optional rules somewhat 
weaken the effectiveness of groups, 
but they make the role of the leader 
more important. A leader becomes 
signiﬁcant even in an untrained group.
Effective group tactics require 
both discipline and morale. In battle, 
both of these will be tested.
DISCIPLINE
A Discipline roll is required when-
ever the group is tempted to break 
formation, either because the group 
is executing a tricky maneuver or 
because the enemy seems vulnerable 
(tempting the group’s members to 
pursue them). Discipline rolls do not 
take an action to make. If a Discipline 
roll fails, the group temporarily be-
comes Disordered.
GROUP DISCIPLINE:  
stress die + Leader’s Presence + 
Leader’s Leadership
If everyone in the group has a 
positive Loyal personality score, the 
group gains an additional bonus equal 
to the lowest Loyal score among the 
members.
Example discipline Ease Factors 
are given below:
EASE FACTOR: 3
EXAMPLE EVENT: Group moves across 
difﬁcult terrain.
EASE FACTOR: 6
EXAMPLE EVENTS: Group runs (with-
out charging); Or, enemy Dis-
engages (without routing); Or, 
group changes between melee and 
missile combat. 
EASE FACTOR: 9
EXAMPLE EVENTS: Enemy routs; Or, 
group Disengages.
MORALE
All groups need to make morale 
rolls when bad things happen to them 
on the battleﬁeld. Morale rolls do not 
take an action to make. A group that 
fails a morale check becomes Disor-
dered. If the group is already Disor-
dered and then fails a Morale check, 
it routs.
GROUP MORALE:  
stress die + Leader’s Pre + Leader’s 
Leadership 
If everyone in the group has a posi-
tive Brave personality score, the group 
gains a bonus to the Morale roll equal 
to the lowest Brave score in the group.
Example morale Ease Factors are 
given below:
EASE FACTOR: 6
EXAMPLE EVENTS: Taking wounds from 
missile ﬁre when having no mis-
siles of its own; Or, charged by ap-
proximately equal force.
EASE FACTOR: 9
EXAMPLE EVENTS: Charged by obvi-
ously superior force; Or, ambushed 
or attacked from rear; Or, all mem-
bers of group reach Wound Penal-
ty of –3 or worse; Or, the vanguard 
or leader killed, Incapacitated, or 
disabled by magic.
DISORDERED GROUPS
A group that fails a Discipline or 
Morale check becomes Disordered. 
This is a bad state of affairs that leaves 
the group vulnerable in combat.
• A trained group that is Disordered 
functions as an untrained group. If 
it fails a second Discipline check, 
it functions like a Disordered un-
trained group.
• An untrained group that is Disor-
dered can’t attack effectively: only 
half its attacks (round up) can hit, 
and the others automatically miss. 
That is, instead of inﬂicting dam-
age once per member of the group, 
it only inﬂicts damage half that 
many times (round up).
• If a group that is Disordered fails a 
Morale check (but not a Discipline 
check), it becomes Routed.
ROUTED GROUPS
A routed group has lost its will to 
ﬁght and attempts to Disengage from 
all opponents and ﬂee to safety. Once 
Disengaged from the enemy, it’s not 
uncommon for the members of a rout-
ed group to scatter.
A group can become Routed if it 
is already Disordered and then fails a 
Morale check.
RALLYING A GROUP
If a group becomes Disordered or 
Routed, the leader may attempt to 


--- Page ---

58
Grogs
rally it as an action. Rallying improves 
a routed group to being merely Disor-
dered, or restores a Disordered group 
to normal status.
RALLY A GROUP: 
Presence + Leadership + stress Die
The Ease Factor to rally a group 
depends on whether the group is En-
gaged in combat, and how many casu-
alties it has taken. A casualty is a mem-
ber of the group who has a Medium 
or worse wound, or is unconscious or 
unable to ﬁght due to magical effects.
Example Ease Factors to rally a 
group are given below:
EASE FACTOR: 3
EXAMPLE EVENT: Group is not engaged 
in combat.
EASE FACTOR: 6
EXAMPLE EVENT: Group is taking en-
emy missile ﬁre.
EASE FACTOR: 9
EXAMPLE EVENT: Engaged in melee.
EASE FACTOR: 12
EXAMPLE EVENT: Routed and being 
hotly pursued.
EASE FACTOR: +1 to Ease Factor
EXAMPLE EVENT: Group has sustained 
casualties.
EASE FACTOR: +3 to Ease Factor
EXAMPLE EVENT: Group has sustained 
50% casualties or more.
GROUPS WITH NO LEADER
Ordinarily, a group that loses its 
vanguard or leader splits into indi-
viduals (see ArM5, page 173). Un-
der these optional rules, a group that 
loses its vanguard or leader can still 
ﬁght, though it is likely to become 
Disordered.
A group with no vanguard can’t 
attack, but uses the Defense score 
of its best member. The leader of a 
group can designate a new vanguard 
in the middle of battle. If successful, 
this takes effect immediately, and the 
group’s future rolls are based on the 
new vanguard’s statistics. The leader 
can automatically choose a new van-
guard (no roll required) if the group 
spends a round without attacking or 
defending.
REPLACE A VANGUARD IN COMBAT: 
Leader’s Presence + Leadership  
vs. Ease Factor 9
A group with no leader automati-
cally fails any future Morale or Disci-
pline checks. A new leader can assume 
command automatically if the group 
spends a round without ﬁghting (mak-
ing no Attack or Defense rolls). Alter-
natively, a member of the group may 
assume command in combat; if suc-
cessful, this takes effect immediately.
ASSUME LEADERSHIP IN COMBAT:  
Presence + Leadership  
vs. Ease Factor 9
If more than one character suc-
ceeds at this roll in the same round, 
the one with the highest total be-
comes the leader.
Injury  
and Death
Combat is sometimes an inevi-
table consequence of a story, and is 
the principle reason why magi employ 
grogs. However, injuries in Ars Mag-
ica Fifth Edition can be punishing; 
even minor wounds, while not imme-
diately life-threatening, impose limits 
on activities, and there are no easily 
available magics for healing wounds. 
A minor encounter with a group of 
opponents can easily cripple the mis-
sion by wounding all of the grogs, and 
is particularly brutal on the vanguard.
If the characters are close to home, 
it might be possible to send the most 
wounded back, and have them re-
freshed with reinforcements. How-
ever, movement while injured can be 
painfully slow.
Battleﬁeld Injuries
Wounds taken in combat can pose 
a major impediment to continuing an 
expedition. A character with more 
than a –2 Wound Penalty cannot 
make any swift or sudden motions, or 
travel at more than half the usual pace 
without risking his wounds worsening 
(ArM5, page 179). Even a –1 Wound 
Penalty prohibits strenuous activ-
ity without risking the wound. The 
Wound Recovery roll made to prevent 
a wound from worsening is fortunately 
modiﬁed by the Chirurgy Ability of 
any ﬁrst-aider, which is why a cutter is 
a vital member of any grex.
A character with a –1 or –2 Wound 
Penalty can perform sentry duty, but 
cannot usually partake in most off-du-
ty activities such as pitching camp. He 
cannot take double duties on watch 
without having to make a wound-
worsening roll. A character with a 
more severe Wound Penalty cannot 
even perform sentry duty without put-
ting pressure on his ailing body.
FIRST AID
First aid can prevent a wound from 
worsening for a short period of time, 
allowing the patient to get to a place 
of safety for the proper healing of his 
wounds. When tending a patient’s 
wounds, a chirurgeon can make a First 
Aid roll against the Improvement Ease 
Factor of his patient’s most serious 
wound on the Wound Recovery Table 
(ArM5, page 179). If this is success-


--- Page ---

59
Grogs
ful, the patient is treated as one cat-
egory higher with respect to Activity 
While Injured (ArM5, page 178). The 
effects of a successful First Aid roll last 
just one day, and cannot be repeated. 
A botched First Aid roll provokes an 
immediate Wound Recovery roll, and 
the patient receives no First Aid bo-
nus. First aid can also start the healing 
process (see Art & Academe, page 61)
FIRST AID ROLL:  
Dexterity + Chirurgy

MAGICAL FIRST AID
The 10th level Creo Corpus spell 
Bind Wound (ArM5, page 129) prevents 
any wound from worsening while in 
effect, and can be a life saver in many 
situations. Even low-level Creo Cor-
pus spells can grant a modest, long-
term bonus to Wound Recovery rolls, 
which includes those to avoid wounds 
worsening. Covenants commonly cre-
ate an enchantment with one of these 
spells as a constant effect, at least to 
get the vanguard back on his feet. 
Endurance of the Berserkers (ReCo 15) ne-
gates all Wound and Fatigue penalties 
for a short time, but the average hu-
man can only be affected by this spell 
twice before it ceases to have an effect 
(ArM5, page 134).
A more powerful enchantment 
consists of a long duration Chirurgeon’s 
Healing Touch (CrCo 20), which re-
moves a wound entirely for as long 
as the character is under its inﬂuence 
(ArM5, page 129). However, this 
spell would have to be boosted to 
Sun Duration, meaning that it would 
inﬂict a Warping point every time 
it is used for the strong mystical ef-
fect (ArM5, page 168). Furthermore, 
it could only negate a Light Wound; 
more powerful effects would be need-
ed for more serious wounds. Natu-
rally, a magus with the ritual form of 
this spell and the vis spare can negate 
such a wound altogether.
The Death of a Grog
It is an uncomfortable truth that 
soldiers die; even more, they are ex-
pected to die. Their purpose, after all, 
is to place themselves between danger 
and their masters. Particularly lucky 
or skilled soldiers sometimes last long 
enough to start families, or even re-
tire. Even luckier grogs get to live at 
covenants where the magi are either 
so peaceful or so formidable that the 
risk of death or serious injury is mini-
mal. Yet for most turbs, the passing of 
a grog is depressingly frequent.
Some troupes prefer to play grogs 
as an expendable resource, and barely 
mark their passing. It is unlikely that 
the turb itself is so blasé about death. 
In the heat of the battle, they may not 
note the passing of their comrade, and 
even if they do, they will not dare to 
let it affect them. When the heat of 
battle has passed, though, they gather 
up the dead and mourn their loss.
The medieval attitude to death is a 
mixture of reverence and superstition. 
In Christian thought, a “good death” is 
at the end of a long life. The deceased 
is reconciled with the community 
and with God through the sacrament 
of Extreme Unction (or Last Rites), 
which spiritually prepares him for the 
journey to the next life. Most impor-
tantly, he has done penance for all his 
sins in this life, and received forgive-
ness. But soldiers hardly ever die in 
this manner. Christians fear the quick 
death, the mors improvisia, because it 
robs them of the opportunity to ren-
der themselves penitentially into a 
state of grace.
It is considered important for a ca-
daver to be physically clean as a sym-
bol of the desired spiritual cleanliness, 
and the body of a fallen comrade is 
washed clean of blood and, if possible, 
wrapped in a clean linen sheet. Grogs 
often turn to the magi in the absence of 
a priest for Extreme Unction. As Latin 
speakers, it is often assumed that magi 
can perform priestly duties. Indeed, in 
dire circumstances, this sacrament can 
be performed by any baptized mem-
ber of the Church; ordination is not 
a requirement. However, when per-

Grogs
formed by an ordained priest, Extreme 
Unction absolves the person from all 
mortal sins and protects the spirit of 
the deceased from supernatural effects 
for three days (Realms of Power: The Di-
vine Revised Edition, page 75); this is usu-
ally sufﬁcient time for the body to be 
buried in consecrated ground.
Grogs usually show a strong desire 
to carry their fallen comrade home. 
Tradition dictates that a body is bur-
ied in the same parish as his birth, but 
some covenants maintain their own 
graveyard for more far-ﬂung members 
of their community. The inability to 
recover a body, or to return it home, 
is a painful thing, and grogs leave be-
hind a fallen comrade with great reluc-
tance. A magus suggesting that a body 
be abandoned is likely to provoke 
feelings of rebellion, and can result 
in the loss of Prevailing Loyalty (see 
Covenants, page 40). If the body must 
be left behind, it is important that it 
is buried whole, not burnt or dismem-
bered, and the grave must be marked. 
The grogs may express a desire to re-
turn for the body at a later date, to en-
sure that it receives the correct burial 
rites. Curiously, the same reverence is 
usually shown for the dead even if an 
individual was disliked in life. 
REMEMBRANCE
Grogs often institute some com-
munal ritual to revere their deceased 
comrades. The liber gregis suggests that 
this is permitted, even encouraged 
by the magi. A roll of the fallen, dis-
played in a prominent place and cer-
emonially inscribed with the names 
of deceased grogs, is a good way to 
achieve this. Even if the grogs can-
not actually read the honor roll, they 
know which names correspond to 
their particular friends, and know that 
they will not be themselves forgotten 
when death comes for them. The liber 
gregis also suggests that, once a year, 
on All Souls’ Day (November 1), the 
magi lead a ceremony remembering 
the fallen, and pleads that covenants 
ﬁnd the money to add the grog’s name 
to the obituary of a local monastery, 
so that prayers will be said to speed his 
time in purgatory.
If a grog has left behind a wife or 
family, they will often be cared for by 
the troop. Any pension owed to the 
deceased individual devolves to them, 
and the other grogs often contribute 
what aid they can afford. It is not un-
usual for a close friend of the deceased 
grog to offer to marry the widow, so 
that she will be well-cared for and her 
children protected from poverty.
It is not necessary for every grog 
death to be played out in detail, but 
it is worth it on occasion, so that the 
grog can be remembered in death as 
much as he was in life.

Character creation can be a te-
dious business, and the purpose of 
this chapter is to make it easier. When 
you are creating a magus or compan-
ion character, it is worth putting in 
the extra effort of Detailed Character 
Creation (ArM5, page 28), as you can 
expect to be playing this character for 
several years or decades of game time. 
Grogs, however, tend to have shorter 
life spans and even shorter life expec-
tancies, but simply using the character 
templates in Ars Magica Fifth Edition 
results in grogs who are all too similar. 
This chapter aims to ﬁnd a middle way 
between these two extremes.
The rules presented here also al-
low grogs to be easily maintained, so 
they are kept up to date and ready 
for action. Herein also are rules for 
allowing a character to expand be-
yond his original concept, and per-
haps even transform into a compan-
ion character.
Virtues  
and Flaws
A freshly-created character has 
as many points of Virtues as she has 
points of Flaws, but characters are ex-
pected to change over time, and an 
individual need not remain that way 
forever. In addition to gaining Flaws 
through misadventure or foolish ac-
tions, a character can gain Virtues 
through exposure (deliberate or not) 
to powerful magic, and may also gain 
them as a result of stories.
Sometimes, after a character has 
been played for a while, it might 
become apparent that she has the 
wrong complement of Virtues and 
Flaws. Perhaps the player decides 
that Wrathful is an inappropriate 
choice for his sentry, and thinks that 
Reclusive might be more appropri-
ate. In cases like this, with the ap-
proval of the troupe, these changes 
can simply be made. If the character 
is quite new to the saga, then even 
major changes can be applied with 
little effect, but changes in an estab-
lished character should be restricted 
— a Minor Flaw can be exchanged 
for another Minor Flaw, and a Major 
Flaw for a Major Flaw, and the same 
applies to Virtues. Changes should 
not be made that affect the Charac-
teristics or Abilities of a character, 
and one should certainly not discard 
a Virtue or Flaw that has been a ma-
jor feature of a story in the past.
These changes are minor in com-
parison to a character who wants to 
develop in new ways, and expand 
himself beyond his original profes-
sion. Perhaps a grog aspires to become 
a priest, or rid himself of a Maledic-
tion. The rest of this section describes 
the process by which these changes 
can be made.
Gaining New Flaws
It is comparatively easy for char-
acters to gain new Flaws. These are 
often the consequence of player ac-
tions, and need no special proce-
dures or effort to allow them to hap-
Creating &  
Maintaining Grogs
Chapter Five
Changes in Social Status
Among all the alterations to Vir-
tues and Flaws, the Social Status Vir-
tues and Flaws are perhaps the most 
likely to occur. One of the coven-
folk can be promoted to custos after 
years of service. A freeman can take 
Holy Orders and become a priest. 
A knight can be disgraced and take 
up life as an outlaw. If these changes 
occur, simply replace the old So-
cial Status Virtue with the new one. 
Only in some circumstances do 
characters retain the old social sta-
tus in addition to the new one, and 
these are clearly indicated in the 
Virtue or Flaw description.

Grogs
pen — most characters will not go 
out of their way to make their life 
worse, but sometimes misfortune be-
falls them. 
An important distinction to make 
is that changing circumstances need 
not actually generate Flaws, even if 
there is a Flaw that describes the situ-
ation the character is now in. Only 
if the change in circumstance has an 
effect on the game, becomes a story 
seed, or alters how the character is ro-
leplayed should this actually be treat-
ed as a Flaw. For example, a character 
who loses a hand to gangrene always 
gains the Missing Hand Flaw, because 
having only one hand always has a 
mechanical effect on the game. How-
ever, a character who gets married 
does not always gain the Dependents 
Flaw. Only if the player is interested 
in having adventures based on his 
character’s wife and children should 
he acquire the Flaw. The storyguide 
should be careful not to allow a grog 
character to gain a Story Flaw, unless 
it is temporary in nature or the charac-
ter is destined for transformation into 
a more central role in the saga (see 
Transformation, later).
GAINING FLAWS  
THROUGH MISHAPS
The easiest way to gain a Flaw is 
through misfortune. Most often, Gen-
eral Flaws are gained through mishap, 
particularly those that affect the body. 
Occasionally, chirurgeons have to am-
putate limbs to save a patient’s life (Art 
& Academe, page 62), and in the heat of 
battle, horriﬁc injuries occur with star-
tling regularity (Art & Academe, pages 
43–44; Lords of Men, page 125). Fur-
thermore, many of the diseases that 
abound in Mythic Europe can result in 
permanent injuries such as blindness, 
deafness, and palsy.
GAINING FLAWS  
THROUGH ACTIONS
Character actions can easily lead 
to changes in social status (see insert 
earlier), with characters becoming 
branded criminals or outlaws. With 
the approval of the storyguide, a 
character can gain Story Flaws by 
starting a feud, becoming indebted 
to a powerful individual, or acquir-
ing an animal companion, although 
grogs are usually prohibited from 
gaining Story Flaws during the game, 
much as they are off limits during 
character creation. Offending a fa-
erie is a good way of gaining a Male-
diction or disﬁgurement.
GAINING FLAWS THROUGH MAGIC
There are some hedge wizard tra-
ditions that can impose Flaws on an 
individual in the form of curses: for 
example, the Malediction Power of 
infernalists (Realms of Power: The Infer-
nal, page 109) or the Grant Power of 
faerie wizards (Realms of Power: Faerie, 
page 127). These are often used offen-
sively against enemies, but are usually 
limited in duration.
More damaging are the permanent 
Flaws that can be imposed by certain 
supernatural creatures at a cost to their 
Might Score. These curses are a per-
manent alteration to the character, 
although it may be possible to eventu-
ally undo the curse (see Losing Flaws, 
later). Furthermore, Warping induces 
the acquisition of Flaws in those char-
acters who are not aligned to a Super-
natural Realm (ArM5, page 168).
Gaining New Virtues
Much like Flaws, a character need 
not settle for the Virtues chosen for 
him at character creation. There are 
three principle ways in which new 
Virtues can be gained: through mag-
ic, through initiation, and through 
actions. These methods are de-
scribed later. 
If a Virtue is gained that affects the 
way in which a character gains experi-
ence points, this does not affect any 
experience points gained thus far. So 
a character who gains an Afﬁnity with 
an Ability does not immediately re-
calculate all the experience points ap-
plied to that Ability so far.

GAINING VIRTUES  
THROUGH MAGIC
There are an assortment of su-
pernatural methods through which 
a character can gain new Virtues, al-
though many of these methods grant 
the Virtue on a temporary basis, such 
as a gruagach’s spells (Hedge Magic Re-
vised Edition, page 65), an Object of Vir-
tue (Realms of Power: Magic, page 124), 
or faerie wizardry (Realms of Power: Fa-
erie, page 127). 
However, there are some ways that 
a Virtue can be granted permanently, 
through the agency of a supernatu-
ral being. The Goetic Arts (Realms of 
Power: The Infernal, page 114) can rip 
a power from a supernatural creature 
and give it to a human, and some 
magical creatures and faeries have the 
power to permanently grant Virtues at 
the cost of reducing their Might score. 
The acquisition of Virtues in this man-
ner should never be frivolous, and 
either be guided by the needs of the 
story, or actively sought as the object 
of a story. 
Finally, severe Warping can result 
in Virtue acquisition. Typically, the 
Virtues gained from Warping reﬂect 
the source of the supernatural power 
that caused it.
GAINING VIRTUES  
THROUGH INITIATION
Initiation is a mystical process 
through which a character acquires 
Virtues through the rituals of a mys-
tery cult (see Chapter 2 of The Mys-
teries Revised Edition for more details) or 
traditions of hedge magic (Hedge Magic 
Revised Edition, page 12). The character 
must develop a score in the Organi-
zation Lore of the cult or tradition in 
question before even being considered 
for Initiation. The Initiation process 
itself is balanced internally, requiring 
the character to pay for her new vir-
tue in ordeals, quests, sacriﬁces, and 
study. It is perhaps most common for 
grog characters to be Initiated into 
the Ceremony Ability (see any of the 
Realm of Power books for their speciﬁc 
variants) to enhance the supernatural 
powers of a companion or magus-
equivalent character. 
Initiation can occur “off-stage” for 
grogs, but it is unusual for non-magi-
cal individuals to partake in a mystery 
cult or secret society to the degree of 
achieving Initiation. Joining a hedge 
magic tradition is perhaps more likely, 
but also more difﬁcult since they tend 
to be wary of those associated with 
the Order of Hermes.
GAINING VIRTUES  
THROUGH ACTIONS
Sometimes a character’s actions 
through the course of a story results 
in him acquiring the effects of a Vir-
tue. Typically, Virtues gained in this 
way reﬂect social interaction with 
storyguide characters. For example, a 
character can gain the effects of the 
Social Contacts Virtue by recruiting 
an agent, or the Protection Virtue by 
making a friend with inﬂuence, as-
suming that these are not just passing 
associations. The troupe should be 
cautious about a grog gaining a Major 
Virtue, unless the character is destined 
for transformation into a more impor-
tant role (see later).
Losing Flaws
Most of the methods by which 
Virtues can be gained (see earlier) 
can also rid a character of Flaws, but 
not all methods are applicable to all 
Flaws. A character with a Missing 
Hand cannot grow it back through 
Initiation, but must instead resort to 
supernatural means. However, char-
acters may be able to take part in 
stories that rid themselves of a curse, 
for example.
Character Transformation
A grog character need not re-
main a grog for life. The dividing 
line between grog and companion 
is a conceit of the game mechanics, 
separating the support characters 
from those on whom the stories are 
focused. However, sometimes grogs 
may grow to transcend their original 
roles, and become central characters 
around which stories pivot. The chief 
game difference between grogs and 
companions is the number and type 
of Virtues and Flaws, and while sev-
eral methods are discussed earlier in 
this chapter by which a character 
can change or expand his choices in 
Virtues and Flaws, converting a grog 
character into a companion charac-
ter through these methods would be 
slow indeed, taking years (if not de-
cades) of game time.
This section presents some ideas 
as to how a character can be sud-
denly transformed from a grog char-
acter to a companion character. The 
essential ﬁrst stage to this process is 
a reason to do so. The vast majority 
of grogs do not transform into com-
panion characters, and so for this to 
happen implies something special 
has occurred. This is nearly always 
precipitated by a story. This story 
should go some way to explain how 
and why the character has just gained 
more Virtues and Flaws. The troupe 
should be careful to ensure that these 
Virtues and Flaws are appropriate 
to the type of transformation — it 
would be very unusual for a grog who 
has just become the leader of his own 
mercenary company to suddenly ac-
quire the Large Virtue, for example, 
while this might be possible for a 
character who drunk a faerie potion. 
Remember that a companion char-
acter need not take all ten points of 
Flaws, and do not be tempted to add 
inappropriate Flaws just to gain more 
Virtue points.

INAUGURATION
Those events which result in the 
investiture of a character with tempo-
ral or spiritual authority are termed 
inaugurations. This variety of trans-
formation is usually accompanied 
by a change in social status. Typical 
inaugurations result from attempts at 
social mobility: a craftsman becomes 
dean of his guild; a priest becomes 
bishop; or a scholar achieves his 
doctorate. However, an inauguration 
need not be planned by the character 
involved; it might result from a sud-
den windfall, or an unexpected turn 
of events. 
Exempli gratia: A character ﬁnds a power-
ful artifact on adventure. It was intended for a 
companion character, but a grog got there ﬁrst. 
To represent the central role of that artifact and 
its wielder in the saga, the troupe agrees that 
the character can become a companion.
Exempli gratia: The storyguide has 
planned a long series of adventures that will 
shape the saga to come for many years, but 
what it really needs is for the covenant to 
have a tame nobleman. However, the saga has 
been going for a few years now, and the play-
ers already have companion characters. The 
storyguide has a quiet word with Elaine, the 
creator of Sir Edwin, who is a grog character 
despite his noble birth. With Elaine’s agree-
ment, she designs a story where Sir Edwin is 
able to restore his family fortunes by prov-
ing the malfeasance of a neighboring baron. 
Sir Edwin is awarded the deposed baron’s ﬁef, 
and becomes a Landed Noble and a compan-
ion character. The new Flaws and Virtues he 
acquires are all related to the lands and feuds 
he has inherited.
METAMORPHOSIS
The process of metamorphosis is 
a magical change which overcomes a 
character and permanently changes 
him into something else. This power 
can conceivably come from any of 
the realms of power, but is probably 
controlled by non-human inhabit-
ants of that realm rather than by hu-
man artiﬁce. Metamorphosis often 
results in the acquisition of Super-
natural Virtues and Flaws from the 
appropriate realm. Metamorphosis 
can easily just happen to a character, 
rather than be speciﬁcally sought out 
or quested for. However, the goal of 
some secret societies is to effect a 
metamorphosis of their leader into a 
supernatural being.
Exempli gratia: The Queen of Winter 
was an antagonist that the storyguide had in-
tended to be an ongoing foe for the characters, 
but through the lucky guesses of the player 
characters, they managed to pierce the faerie’s 
disguise and slay her in the ﬁrst encounter. 
One of the covenant’s grogs delivered the kill-
ing blow, and the storyguide decides that the 
Queen lays on him her death-curse. Over 
the next few months, the grog undergoes some 
odd transformations, each of which forms the 
focus of a story. By the shortest day of the 
year, Winter has a new faerie King under the 
control of the storyguide. After the story arc 
is complete, she decides that the covenant can 
reverse the transformation of the grog, but the 
experience leaves him permanently altered, 
and he is better off re-envisioned as a faerie-
touched companion character.
INITIATION
Initiation can simply add Virtues 
to a character, but initiation into a 
mystery cult can also be a means to 
transform a character. A grog can 
easily remain a grog character as a 
member of a cult — they can play a 
support role just as well inside a se-
cret society as they can anywhere 
else — but seeking to join such a cult 
displays a level of dedication or self-
importance that is more suited to a 
companion character. The cult can 
provide a means to upgrade the char-
acter’s importance in a saga. Of all 
the methods presented here, initia-
tion is perhaps the most likely to pro-
duce a Mythic Companion, which is 
a magus-equivalent character. Some 
Mystery Cults have as their ultimate 
goal some form of magical alteration 
of a character; this is more of a meta-
morphosis transformation than an 
Initiation as such.
Exempli gratia: A morbid grog who has 
been a grave-robber under a necromancer for 
years seeks initiation into the Disciples of the 
Worm, a Hermetic mystery cult. The standard 
initiatory path is designed for magi, but the 
storyguide has determined that the cult also 
accepts mundanes. As part of his initiation, 
the grog becomes bound to the ghost of an Old 
One (whatever that is), and discovers that he 
has a host of new abilities, many of them su-
pernatural.
PILGRIMAGE
Pilgrimage can be a life-changing 
event. Characters embark on a pil-
grimage for all sorts of reasons — not 
all of them matters of piety — but 
those who return are usually changed 
in some manner. Going on pilgrimage 
can be a good pretext for a planned 
change in character, whether the 
journey (physical and spiritual) is 
played out in stories or occurs behind 
the scenes. For more information 
on pilgrimage, see The Church, pages 
15–19.
This type of transformation need 
not be taken literally. Any story or 
story arc that takes a character out of 
his normal routine and location, tests 
his character, and then transforms his 
life forever is a pilgrimage. This in-
cludes such stories as: going on Cru-
sade; embarking on the Grail Quest; 
undertaking the “black pilgrimage” to 
the unholy city of Chorazin; or seeing 
the jinn-haunted streets of Irem of the 
Pillars. When the character returns 
from such a journey, he will never be 
the same again, a change that is partic-
ularly well-represented by transform-
ing into a companion character.
Exempli gratia: Peter, a companion char-
acter, dies tragically, but the story arc planned 
for him was never even started. This involved

Grogs
Peter’s lycanthropy, his wife and daughter, 
and a rather unpleasant and powerful non-
Hermetic sorcerer from their distant homeland. 
His son, hitherto a grog character, decides to 
take up his father’s quest, and in the process 
become a companion character for the player 
who used to play Peter.
Characteristics
Every character has 7 points to 
spend on buying positive Character-
istics, and can take up to 7 negative 
points to gain an equal number of ad-
ditional points for positive Character-
istics (ArM5, page 30). Various Vir-
tues and Flaws can alter the number of 
points gained, or affect the ﬁnal Char-
acteristics once the points have been 
spent. The nearby insert has several 
arrays of Characteristics bought with 
the standard number of points; simply 
pick one for your character.
Aging, the Easy Way
Characters who are 35 years old 
or older usually need to make ag-
ing rolls each year. When creating 
an old character, or updating a large 
number of grogs, making aging rolls 
can be time-consuming. The Aging 
Chart in the nearby insert presents 
the expected number of Aging Points 
gained for a decade of aging. Since 
the results of the aging roll are quite 
variable, results have been presented 
for mild, average, and harsh years. 
To use the table, decide whether the 
grog has experienced mild, average, 
or harsh aging for each decade, then 
cross-reference the row that corre-
sponds to the character’s Aging Score. 
The Aging Score is equal to the Aging 
Total excluding the stress die: age/10 
(round up) – Living Conditions modi-
ﬁer – Longevity Ritual modiﬁer. The 
character takes the indicated number 
of Aging Points. Apparent Age can be 
determined by rolling a simple die. If 
it is less than or equal to the indicated 
number of Aging Points, then Appar-
ent Age advances 10 years for that de-
cade, otherwise it advances a number 
of years equal to the die roll. If the 
character has spent part of a decade at 
one Aging Score and part at another, 
use the higher score for the whole de-
cade. To deal with fractional decades, 
just take an appropriate proportion of 
the numbers indicated, rounding all 
fractions up.
Exempli gratia: Paul the Grog is designed 
as a 45 year old character. Rather than mak-
ing 10 aging rolls, his player consults the Ag-
ing Chart. His Living Conditions Modiﬁer is 
0, so he has 6 years with an Aging Score of 4 
(from 35 to 40 years old) and 4 years with an 
Aging Score of 5 (from 41 to 45 years old); 
but this is treated as 10 years at an Aging 
Score of 5. He therefore takes 5 Aging Points. 
Had the storyguide required him to use the 
harsh aging column, he would have had 6 Ag-
ing Points instead.
At character creation, harsh ag-
ing might represent a character who 
has adventured a lot prior to his in-
troduction as a player character, and 
he might be permitted to start with 
Ability Scores 1 point higher than his

Aging Chart
The numbers in the nearby table indicate the number of Aging Points 
and the number of crises expected to be gained by a character in a decade 
at different Aging Scores. For more details, see ArM5, pages 169–170. The 
Aging Points listed exclude those deriving from crises. Aging Scores of less 
than 4 are provided for those with good Living Conditions Modiﬁers.

age would normally permit (ArM5, 
page 31). Likewise, a character tak-
ing mild aging might be restricted 
to lower maximum Ability Scores. 
Characters with the Mild Aging Vir-
tue or Poor Conditions Flaw (see 
Chapter 6: New Virtues and Flaws) 
would be required to suffer mild or 
harsh aging, respectively. After char-
acter creation, the storyguide might 
dictate that conditions around the 
covenant affect which type of aging 
characters suffer, due to mild winters, 
uncommonly good or bad conditions 
at the covenant, outbreaks of disease, 
and so forth.
APPLYING CRISES
It is up to the storyguide as to 
whether the character suffers the 
crises listed on the table; in particu-
lar, she might be inclined to ignore 
crises for newly created characters, 
since Decrepitude can quickly crip-
ple a character.
The Aging Points listed on the Ag-
ing Chart only apply if the character 
suffers no crises. If crises are applied, 
then the character gains a Decrepi-
tude score equal to the number of 
crises suffered, and the appropriate 
number of Aging Points for that level 
of Decrepitude. He also gains a num-
ber of additional Aging Points: if he 
suffers one crisis, then he gets half of 
the Aging Points listed in the Aging 
Chart; if he suffers two crises, then he 
gets one-third; and so on. Round all 
fractions up.
Exempli gratia: If the storyguide requires 
Paul to account for crises, he experiences one 
for his decade of average aging. He therefore 
has a Decrepitude of 1, and 5 Aging Points, 
along with an additional 3 Aging Points (half 
of the 5, he would have gained without crises, 
rounded up), for a total of 8 Aging Points. 
Had he experienced harsh aging, then he 
would have suffered two crises, granting him 
a Decrepitude 2 and 15 Aging Points, plus an 
additional 2 (one-third of 6), for a total of 17. 
EFFECTS OF AGING  
ON CHARACTERISTICS
All Aging Points must be applied 
to the Characteristics of the character 
in the usual fashion. The Aging Table 
(ArM5, page 170) is designed to af-
fect certain Characteristics in favor 
of others. Just under half of all Aging 
Points gained (excluding those from 
crises) are applied to any Character-
istic (that is, a roll of 10–12 on the 
Aging Table). Of the remaining Aging 
Points, approximately half are gained 
in Quickness or Stamina, 30 percent 
in Perception or Presence, 15 percent 
in Strength or Dexterity, and the re-
mainder in Intelligence and Commu-
nication. Players should bear these 
distributions in mind when applying 
Aging Points to a character.
Childhood Training Packages
The ﬁve childhood packages 
from Ars Magica Fifth Edition (page 
31) are presented here in the same

Grogs
Abilities
Non-magus characters receive 15 
experience points every year. This is 
an average value, based on two sea-
sons of exposure (4 experience 
points), one season of practice 
(4 experience points), and one 
“vocational” season of teach-
ing, training, adventuring, or 
reading books (7 experience 
points). For example, a soldier 
might spend one season being 
taught Single Weapon by the 
drill sergeant with the rest of 
the turb, practicing the Hunt 
Ability in the woods, and gain-
ing exposure in Awareness and 
Athletics from his sentry duty.
Poor characters have to re-
place the vocational season with 
another season of exposure. 
Wealthy characters gain an ex-
tra vocational season instead of 
one of the seasons of exposure.
Updating Grogs
Applying yearly experi-
ence points to grogs need not 
be a chore. Those who are em-
ployed by the magi on a regu-
lar basis can be updated once 
a year, in the winter season. 
Each player should be respon-
sible for updating an equal 
number of the regular grogs. 
The grog captain determines 
which Ability has been taught 
that year (probably Single 
Weapon), and all grogs gain 7 
experience points in that Abil-
ity (you can use the Teaching 
Quality of the drill sergeant if you 
prefer). For non-soldiers, determine 
other sources of experience points 
for this vocational season, and ap-
ply either 7 experience points or the 
Source Quality, if it is known. The 
player then applies 4, 2, and 2 expe-
rience points to up to three different 
Abilities, representing the season of 
practice, and two seasons of expo-
sure. Remember to update the age of 
the grog, and the current year on the 
character sheet, and determine aging 
if applicable.
If a grog has taken story experi-
ence points, these should be applied 
immediately when they are received, 
and a note made on the character 
sheet. During the winter update, the 
grog loses a season of regular experi-
ence points for each award of story 
experience points. It is recommended 
that seasons are exchanged in the fol-
lowing order: exposure, vocational, 
practice, exposure. So a char-
acter taking two seasons of 
story experience points loses 
one exposure season and his 
vocational season.
Grogs who are used infre-
quently can be updated every 
three or ﬁve years, simply by 
applying an appropriate train-
ing package (see later). Remem-
ber to make a note of the last 
time the character was updated 
on her character sheet. Use the 
table given earlier under Aging 
to determine any effects of the 
passage of years. 
Training Packages
Calculating Ability scores 
can be one of the most time 
consuming parts of character 
creation. This section intro-
duces a quick and easy way of 
building a character through 
training packages. These train-
ing packages work exactly the 
same way as the childhood 
packages, applying a number 
of experience points in certain 
Abilities. The process can be 
used for grogs, companions, 
and for the pre-apprenticeship 
years for magi. 
A package adds a certain 
number of years to the charac-
ter’s age; some add three years, 
and others add either three 
or ﬁve years, depending on choice. 
Along with these years come experi-
ence points in various Abilities. Most 
characters will take the same package 
more than once, to give them a con-
centration in their core Abilities. Each 


--- Page ---

68
Grogs
of the training packages assumes that 
the character spends his vocational 
seasons training the key Ability of 
that package, and his practice seasons 
contribute either to the key Ability or 
to a secondary Ability. Some training 
packages require that the character 
can take Academic, Arcane, or Mar-
tial Abilities (this is indicated after 
the package name), and therefore the 
character needs a Virtue that permits 
this. A starting character should not 
be built with more than 15 years in a 
single package; few individuals are this 
single-minded.
Remember that a starting charac-
ter cannot have more than 75 experi-
ence points (a score of 5) in an Abil-
ity unless they are 30 or older (ArM5, 
page 31), or have an Afﬁnity. If a par-
ticular build results in more than 75 
experience points, then the excess 
should be redistributed among the 
character’s other Abilities. If the char-
acter has an Afﬁnity with an Ability, 
add up all the experience points he 
receives in that Ability from training 
packages, then add half as many ex-
perience points again.
To round the character off, you 
may need to add one or two more 
years of age, and distribute the re-
sulting experience points to bring 
some Abilities up to the next score. 
If the character has any Supernatu-
ral Abilities, this method should be 
used to pay for those Abilities, but 
remember that the character starts 
with 5 free experience points in any 
Supernatural Ability.
GROG BACKGROUNDS
Soldiers — particularly soldiers of 
fortune like grogs — are rarely born 
into a military family. Even grogs 
born to the covenant might have 
trained in other skills before taking 
up the sword. When building a grog 
with training packages, you are en-
couraged to give them a few years in 
labor, craft, or professional trades to 
represent what they did before they 
became a warrior. It is also a way of 
generating a simple but interesting 
back story: if a character spent the 
ﬁrst eight years of his post-childhood 
life as a Farmer, and then ﬁve years as 
a Woodsman before taking ﬁve years 
as a Soldier, what circumstances lead 
him to abandon his farm at the age 
of 13 and take up residence in the 
woods? Did he become a bandit? Per-
haps he was a forester?
Career Training 
Packages
These packages represent trades 
or professions to which a character 
might belong. They provide the key 
skills of that trade.
ADVOCATE (ACADEMIC OR NONE)
An advocate has studied law, either 
at a university or through private tu-
tors or a cathedral school. If the char-
acter has the Jurist Virtue (Art & Aca-
deme, page 91), then he need not have a 
Virtue permitting Academic Abilities, 
since this Virtue permits taking the 
key Abilities as a layman. If he has at-
tended university, then he should take 
at least ﬁve years of Student and have 
a Virtue which grants extra experience 
in Academic Abilities. Characters in 
England need Common Law rather 
than Civil and Canon Law.
FIVE YEARS: +40 Civil and Canon Law, 
+5 Leadership, +15 Artes Libera-
les, +15 Latin
THREE YEARS: +30 Civil and Canon 
Law, +5 Leadership, +5 Artes Libe-
rales, +5 Latin
ANIMAL TRAINER
The ﬁve-year package is suitable 
for a professional animal handler, such 
as a master of hounds or an ostler, and 
the Profession can vary accordingly. 
The three-year package is for those 
who have regular contact with animals 
but not as their principle job.
Five Years: +30 Animal Handling, +30 
Profession: Animal Trainer, +15 
Ride
THREE YEARS: +30 Animal Handling, 
+15 Ride
APOTHECARY
FIVE YEARS: +15 (Area) Lore, +20 
Chirurgy, 
+40 
Profession: 
Apothecary
THREE

ARCHER (MARTIAL)
FIVE YEARS: +20 Awareness, +40 Bows, 
+15 Concentration
THREE YEARS: +15 Awareness, +30 Bows
Wealthy and Poor Characters
For characters with the Wealthy 
Virtue, use the Training Packages 
method as described, but reduce 
the character’s post-childhood age 
by one quarter. So a character who 
takes 32 years’ worth of training 
packages after childhood is only 29 
years old, rather than 37.
For characters with the Poor 
Flaw, increase the post-childhood 
age by one half. That means a char-
acter with 13 years’ worth of train-
ing is actually 25 years old rather 
than 18.

CHURCHMAN (ACADEMIC)
Suitable for priests, friars, and 
nuns who have had some training 
within the church. Academic church-
men should also take the Theologian 
package. Parish priests probably have 
the Public Ofﬁcial or the Leader 
package, replacing some or all of the 
experience in Leadership with Pro-
fession: Preaching (see Art & Academe, 
page 13).

CRAFTSMAN
An apprenticeship in a craft typi-
cally takes eight years, at the end 
of which time the character should 
have a primary Craft Ability of 3 
(see City & Guild, page 42). It is as-
sumed that each craftsman learns 
more than a single Craft Ability 
during a typical apprenticeship, and 
picks up several related trades. Jour-
neymen should take a Trader pack-
age to account for the other Abilities 
he will need, and Masters will need 
the Trainer package.

THREE YEARS: +10 Bargain, +15 Craft:

CULTIST (ARCANE)
A cultist has spent years worshiping 
an evil force in secret. If the character 
has the Ceremony Virtue, he can apply 
some of his experience points in Infer-
nal Lore to that Ability instead. This 
package might also represent a pagan 
(in which case substitute Faerie Lore for 
Infernal Lore), or a devotee of a mys-
tery cult (substitute Organization Lore: 
Cult and Magic Lore for Infernal Lore).
FIVE YEARS: +15 Guile, +50 Infernal 
Lore, +10 Stealth
THREE YEARS: +15 Guile, +30 Infer-
nal Lore
CUNNING MAN (ARCANE)
Knows the local legends and the 
ways of the fae.
THREE YEARS: +10 (Area) Lore, +5 Bar-

A cutter is trained in patching up 
the wounded and administering ﬁrst 
aid; alternatively, he could be an em-
piricus, a traveling surgeon.
THREE YEARS: +40 Chirurgy, +5 Folk 
Ken
FAILED APPRENTICE
The character must have the Failed 
Apprentice Virtue to take this pack-
age, which permits her to take Arcane 
and Academic Abilities. She probably 
has several years of Student to ac-
count for her Academic Abilities. It 
is assumed that she has no Art scores; 
either she has not been Opened to the 
Arts, or else her ability to work Her-
metic magic has been destroyed.

of Virtue by sacriﬁcing 5 experience 
points per object (see Realms of Power: 
Magic, page 124).

A physician is assumed to have at-

Medicine, and so such a character

ties. Many physicians never learn

This package assumes that the 
character has received academic 
teaching at a parish school, cathe-
dral school, or monastic school, or 
from a private tutor. Characters who 
have attended a university receive ad-
ditional experience points from their 
Social Status Virtues (see Art & Academe, 
pages 90–92). Characters attending a 
parish school can only take the three-
year package, since these schools only 
teach Artes Liberales and Latin.

Combat Statistics
It is often tedious to calculate combat statistics for a grog. The follow-
ing table has pre-calculated combat statistics for common weapons, with 
the following assumptions: the character has a 5 in the appropriate Ability 
with a specialty in the weapon indicated; the character has a Dexterity and 
Quickness of 0, a Strength of 0 or equal to the minimum Strength required 
for the weapon (whichever is greater); and the character has zero encum-
brance. It is a quick job to apply the appropriate Characteristics to the com-
bat totals and subtract encumbrance from Initiative.

The System in Action
Elaine wants to play a grog who 
is the younger son of a noble fam-
ily that has fallen on hard times. Sir 
Edwin has nevertheless trained for 
knighthood. He has the Warrior 
Virtue, allowing Martial Abilities. 
Sir Edwin had a Social Childhood, 
and Elaine assumes that he has been 
a Courtier for three years, a Rider 
for six years, and a Soldier for eight 
years. Elaine ends up with a 22 year 
old character with the following ex-
perience points: +30 Animal Han-
dling, +20 Athletics, +30 Brawl, 
+20 Charm, +30 Etiquette, +20 
Folk Ken, +15 Guile, +5 Intrigue, 
+75 Native Language, +60 Ride, 
+70 Single Weapon. Since Sir Ed-
win will be principally using a lance, 
Elaine decides to change the score 
in Single Weapon to Great Weapon 
instead. This leaves the character 
with the following Abilities: Animal 
Handling 3, Athletics 2(5), Brawl 3, 
Charm 2(5), Etiquette 3, Folk Ken 
2(5), Great Weapon 4(20), Guile 2, 
Intrigue 1, Native Language 5, Ride 
4(10). 
Since Sir Edwin has taken the 
Poor Flaw, he is actually 31 years 
old. She applies 35 of the experi-
ence points from the Warrior Virtue 
to the Great Weapon Ability, taking 
it to 6 (since Sir Edwin is older than 
30), and puts the remaining 15 ex-
perience points into Single Weapon 
2. She could make this a score of 3 
with the left-over experience points 
in some of the other Abilities (5 
from Folk Ken and 10 from Ride, 
for example) if she wanted.
Further examples include:
BANDIT: Athletic childhood; Fisher-
man, Woodsman, Scout, Soldier
BEGGAR: Exploring childhood; Tin-
ker, Conman, Local
BURGLAR: Mischievous childhood; 
Local, Footpad, Tumbler

This chapter contains a collec-
tion of new Virtues and Flaws that are 
especially suitable for grogs. These 
new Virtues and Flaws are used in the 
construction of the grog templates in 
Chapter 7, and they open up more 
ways to distinguish the grogs in your 
saga from one another.
New Virtues
These new Virtues are available to 
any character, but may be particularly 
useful for grogs.
ALMOGAVAR
Free, Social Status
The character is a member of a 
band of mercenaries and raiders, liv-
ing a life of adventure according to 
a code of honor and discipline. He 
shares a bond of solidarity with his 
fellows, and they can depend on each 
other’s loyalty. He has Standard Arma-
ments, and may take Martial Abilities. 
He may choose to be the Adalil at no 
additional cost, getting an increase in 
both authority and responsibility. He 
is supported by his unit, and may not 
take the Poor Flaw or Wealthy Virtue.
ALMOGATEN
Minor, Social Status
The character is the leader of a 
band of Almogavars, chosen by his 
fellows for his skill and experience. 
He commands a dozen men, and he is 
responsible for their welfare and pros-
perity. He has Standard Armaments 
and may take Martial Abilities.
Similar to the Mercenary Cap-
tain Virtue, you may choose Wealthy 
or Poor to represent the fortunes of 
the almogaten and his soldiers. If he 
is Poor, he leads only a half-dozen 
men and he has hit hard times lately. 
Some of his men only have Inexpen-
sive Armaments, but his main con-
cern is ﬁnding the next meal. If he is 
Wealthy, he leads a company of two 
dozen men, and can afford to upgrade 
their armaments. The band might 
own several horses, and perhaps some 
herd animals.
CRAFT GUILD TRAINING
Minor, General
This 
character 
has 
received 
above-average training during his ap-
prenticeship, from a craft master or 
professional guild. Like Warrior and 
Educated, this virtue gives a bonus 
of 50 experience points. These must 
be spent on any Craft or Profession 
Abilities, Bargain, or Organization 
Lore: Guild.
DOMESTIC ANIMAL
Minor, Social Status, animals only
The character is an animal who is 
the property of a covenant or char-
acter, and is supplied with food and 
shelter. He is expected to serve his 
master in return for this provender, as 
a mount, beast of burden, hunter, or 
so forth.
FEROCITY
Minor, General, animals only
Like companion and magus char-
acters, this character has Conﬁdence 
points. However, these Conﬁdence 
points may only be used in situations 
where its natural animal ferocity is 
triggered, such as when defending its 
den or ﬁghting a natural enemy. De-
scribe a situation which activates the 
Conﬁdence for its species, and take 3 
Conﬁdence points and a Conﬁdence 
Score of 1 to use when those circum-
stances are met.
FORGETTABLE FACE
Minor, General
Never will this character be the 
one noticed or picked out of a crowd. 
Moments after speaking with him, 
very few people can give an adequate 
description of him. He often gets 
away with things because people are 
not sure it was actually him. If other 
characters must make a roll to identify 
him, it is at –3. On the downside, this 
trait is incompatible with great beauty, 
charisma, or commanding presence. 
Virtues like Venus’ Blessing or Inspira-
tional are prohibited, although Curse 
of Venus could work.

HERMETIC EXPERIENCE
Minor, General
The character has experience with 
the magi of the Order of Hermes. 
Maybe he is currently employed by a 
covenant, once served in the retinue 
of a magus, or has had other dealings 
or disputes with them. In any case, 
you have an additional 50 experience 
points to spend on Order of Hermes 
Lore, Magic Lore, or Latin. You can-
not spend other experience points on 
Magic Lore or Latin unless the charac-
ter has another Virtue or Flaw permit-
ting this. This Virtue may be taken by 
any grog or covenfolk, or those who 
have had an exceptionally close rela-
tionship with the Order of Hermes.
JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES
Minor, General
The character is capable of turn-
ing his hand to almost anything. 
He suffers no additional botch dice 
for attempting an Ability roll for 
an Ability that he has no score in 
(ArM5, page 62). If it is an aster-
isked Ability, then he can attempt a 
roll as if he had a score of zero with 
three extra botch dice, if and only if 
he is normally able to take Abilities 
of that type. Characters without this 
Virtue cannot even attempt rolls on 
an asterisked Ability without at least 
one experience point in it (ArM5, 
page 62). For example, he must have 
a Virtue permitting him to take Ar-
cane Abilities to attempt an unskilled 
Magic Lore roll. Some Abilities are 
excepted from this Virtue, such as 
those that are not rolled (such as 
Parma Magica or Penetration), and 
all Supernatural Abilities (which re-
quire a speciﬁc Virtue for each Abil-
ity, rather than the type).
MASTER OF (FORM) CREATURES
Minor, General
The character is able to tame ani-
mals and other unintelligent beings 
that have a Magic Might aligned 
with a particular Form. During char-
acter creation, the character may 
take Magic Lore, and this Virtue may 
be taken multiple times, once for 
each Form. (This Virtue was origi-
nally presented in Realms of Power: 
Magic.)

MASTER OF KENNELS
(Minor, Social Status)
The character manages the ken-
nels for a noble patron, and is re-
sponsible for the training, breeding, 
and health of the animals. He em-
ploys additional staff appropriate to 
the size of the kennels. He is a com-
moner, yet treated with considerable 
respect by the household. If he has 
the privilege of riding with the hunt, 
then he may well be a skilled bow-
man. He is expected to organize the 
houndsmen, that is the dog handlers, 
as well as instructing servants or lo-
cals to perform that role. The Master 
of Kennels may learn Martial Abili-
ties, and has 50 additional experience 
points at character generation to 
spend on the Abilities Animal Han-
dling, Etiquette, Hunt, Latin, an ap-
propriate Profession Ability (such as 
Feuterer or Farrier), and Ride. (Para-
phrased from Lords of Men.)
MILD AGING
Minor, General
The character’s aging rolls beneﬁt 
from a +1 bonus to the Living Condi-
tions Modiﬁer, in addition to whatever 
his social standing normally offers him 
(ArM5, page 170). Furthermore, he re-
ceives a +3 bonus to rolls to survive an 
aging crisis. He may be dedicated to 
living a healthy life, or else have been 
blessed by some supernatural being.
MINOR ENCHANTMENTS
Minor, Supernatural
The character has one or more 
items in his possession that have 
magical powers. These should be de-
signed as Hermetic enchantments, 
and the total levels of powers in all 
the items, after adjustment for uses 
per day and so forth, must be 25 or 
less. The character may have this Vir-
tue more than once: add the total lev-
els together, but no single power can 
be greater than 30th level. If he loses 
the item or it is destroyed, then it is 
gone for good.
MYTHIC FARRIER
Minor, Supernatural
The character may use the 
Touched by (Realm) Virtue (City & 
Guild, page 71), to a limited extent. 
He may craft horseshoes with magi-
cal effects, using Hermetic guidelines 
for a single Hermetic Form, chosen 
at character creation. Animal is a 
popular choice. The powers of the 
horseshoes can only affect the horse 
itself, or its immediate environment. 
A Terram effect, for instance, to make 
the ground which the horse touches 
stable is permissible, but an Auram 
power to change the weather isn’t. 
To calculate the Craft Total, add 
the controlling characteristic to the 
Craft: Farrier Ability. As this ﬁeld of 
work requires wit as well as deftness 
of hand, either Intelligence or Dexter-
ity may be used; this is a permanent 
choice which must be made at char-
acter creation. This ability is most 
likely aligned with the Magical or Fa-
erie Realm, but an Infernal farrier is a 
possibility. You may take this Virtue 
twice, but no more. Taking the Virtue 
a second time adds either a second 
Form to use while enchanting, or al-
lows the character to use it with an-
other Ability, but not both. For varia-
tions on this Virtue, simply rename 
it Mythic (Professional), and replace 
Craft: Farrier with another Craft Abil-
ity. Retain the limit of a single Ability 
and a single Hermetic Form.
PACK LEADER / NATURAL LEADER
Minor, General
The character is a dominant indi-
vidual with a demeanor that encourag-
es others to do what she says. Her self-
assured manner gives her a +3 bonus 
in social situations in which she takes 
the lead; people are more likely to fol-
low her orders or do as she suggests. If 
she is Gifted, this bonus can temporar-
ily help to overcome the social pen-
alty of The Gift, due to the strength of 
her domineering personality. This Vir-
tue is known as Pack Leader for animal 
grogs, or Natural Leader for humans.
TURB TRAINED
(Minor, Social Status)
This character has grown up at 
the covenant, been trained to ﬁght in 
the turb, and picked up a few things 
from the magi’s trusted servants. At 
character creation, he is allowed to 
learn Martial Abilities. He may also 
learn whichever single dead language 
the magi speak in addition to his lo-
cal tongue. His fortunes are tied to the 
turb, and he is thus prohibited from 
being Wealthy or Poor.
New Flaws
Most of these Flaws are Minor 
Flaws suitable for grog characters.
BOUND TO (ROLE) ROLE
Minor, Supernatural
This character is physically bond-
ed to some form of device, whether 
through a mystic event, long years 
of exposure and warping, or the min-
istrations of an experimental magus. 
The degree of the bonding is for the 
troupe to deﬁne, but the bonding may 
be physical, such as a locksmith whose 
ﬁngers are picks, ﬁles, and keys, or 
mystical, such as a watchman who is 
conﬁned to his watch tower as though 
contained by an unbreakable ward.


--- Page ---

77
Grogs
The manner of this bonding deter-
mines the kind of life that the char-
acter may live. A watchman unable to 
leave his tower may make it his home, 
while a coachman who has become 
part of his coach can not survive for 
long once separated from it.
If separated from the bonded de-
vice or place in any way, the character 
must make deprivation checks (ArM5, 
page 180) as though deprived of food 
(i.e., a check every three days). The 
effects of this are canceled if the char-
acter is brought into contact with the 
device or returned to his bound place, 
at which point they rebond.
This Flaw also includes the effects 
of the Unaging Virtue, but the char-
acter’s apparent age advances in line 
with their physical age. Role-Bound 
characters retain the need to sleep 
and breathe and those not physically 
bonded to a device, such as those 
bound to a place, retain their other 
physical needs.
This Flaw may originate from any 
of the Supernatural Realms: a magical 
origin might represent the expression 
of an Essential Trait, a faerie origin 
could show that the character occu-
pies an archetypal role, ready to play 
his part in the wider story, while di-
vine and infernal origins may repre-
sent eternal punishment on Earth.
This Flaw may only be taken by 
grogs and is suitable for the Warping to 
a Pattern Minor Site Hook presented in 
Covenants, page 11.
BROKEN VESSEL
Minor, Supernatural
The character is constantly aware 
that her supernatural powers may 
only be temporary. Failures using 
those abilities represent the ebbing 
away of the power that sustains them. 
When a zero is rolled on any Stress 
Roll (not Simple Roll) against any of 
her Supernatural Abilities, Powers, or 
in casting spells, she loses 5 experi-
ence points from that Ability or an 
Art involved in the Power or Spell. If 
the roll then botches, the character 
automatically loses enough experi-
ence points to reduce her score in 
the affected Art or Ability by one full 
level (or 5 experience points, which-
ever is greater).
Characters may only take this Flaw 
if they have at least one Supernatu-
ral Ability or Art normally improved 
through experience points.
CARELESS WITH (ABILITY)
Minor, General
The character is particularly reck-
less when it comes to a particular 
Ability, chosen when this Virtue is 
taken. This Ability should be one that 
is important to the character, or the 
troupe may veto the choice of this 
Flaw. When she fails, she does so dra-
matically. Whenever she rolls a zero 
when using the Ability, that zero is

treated as a botch. She may need to 
roll extra botch dice depending on the 
circumstances, but she always suffer 
the effects of at least a single botch. 
This Flaw may be taken more than 
once; each time, it applies to a differ-
ent Ability.
COMPANION ANIMAL
Minor, Social Status, animals only
The character is the Animal Com-
panion of another character (either a 
player character or a storyguide char-
acter) and therefore has little control 
over his own life. He is largely depen-
dent on his master for food and shel-
ter, and has an additional Personality 
Trait of “Loyal to Master” which rep-
resents this bond. Among people who 
know his master, the character is treat-
ed better than he would be, perhaps as 
that person’s pet or bodyguard. Others 
most likely treat him as a brute or a 
dumb beast.
COMPULSIVE LYING
Minor or Major, Personality
Telling the truth is really hard 
for this character. This does not ap-
ply in situations where the answer is 
evident and any lie would be transpar-
ent; he does not claim that the sky is 
green under normal conditions. How-
ever, when he cannot be immediately 
caught out, he ﬁnds it hard to avoid 
embellishing stories, or simply making 
them up. Perhaps he wants to make 
himself look good, perhaps he wants 
to downplay his own part in a conﬂict, 
or perhaps he just loves the power of 
confusing people. As a Minor Flaw, 
this is just a tendency, and the char-
acter can make himself tell the truth 
if it really matters. If taken as a Major 
Flaw, the character cannot resist em-
bellishing a story, no matter what the 
circumstances. At best, he might man-
age to keep the alterations minor.
CRAVING FOR TRAVEL
Minor, General
The character suffers from feelings 
of loneliness, boredom, and depres-
sion if he does not expose himself to 
new experiences. He can stave off the 
boredom for a while, but if he remain 
in one place for more than a season, 
he suffers a –1 penalty to all rolls and 
totals until he experiences a change 
in scene. This penalty rises to –3 af-
ter a year of boredom. This charac-
ter is probably the ﬁrst to volunteer 
for a mission beyond the covenant 
gates, and may even spend part of 
each year in a different location such 
as the nearby wood. This Flaw might 
seem to make the character unsuitable 
for life at a covenant, so you should 
decide what it is at the covenant that 
means he keeps coming back. Perhaps 
it is the love of his life, the camarade-
rie, or perhaps just the feeling that he 
ﬁts in here.
CURSE OF SLANDER
Minor, General or Supernatural
Wherever he stays, unpleasant 
rumors and ill-favored stories about 
this character begin to spread within 
a short time. This can be due to bad 
luck, or it could be something su-
pernatural, like a curse. The slander 
is centered on one speciﬁc section 
of mundane society — the nobility, 
the church, guilds, peasants — and 
it seriously hampers his working life. 
After staying one season in an area, 
he gains a bad Reputation at level 1, 
usually a Local Reputation. He gains 
one point toward raising the Reputa-
tion in each further season, or more if 
he is involved in disturbing or strange 
events. Truly remarkable deeds can 
halt the increase for one season, but 
they will be forgotten come next 
season. At a covenant, people are 
used to strange things and deviant 
behavior. The Reputation is gained 
and increases in intervals of years 
rather than seasons, giving the poor 
victim more time before he becomes 
completely shunned. If the character 
leaves an area, the Reputation stops 
increasing, and may even fall, at the 
troupe’s discretion.
CURSED GUILE
Minor, Supernatural
This is the Flaw for “the boy who 
cried wolf,” and probably results from 
Infernal inﬂuence. The character has 
three extra botch dice when using 
Guile. More importantly, the char-
acter is rarely believed, even when 
he is being honest. He must make a 
Communication + Guile roll against 
an Ease Factor of 9 in order to be be-
lieved when he tells the truth at im-
portant moments. For example, if the 
character is returning from a scouting 
mission, and you fail his Guile roll 
when he reports back, the maga may 
assume that he has been deﬁcient in 
his duties; perhaps she thinks that he 
never went scouting at all, but instead 
went to the nearest town to entertain 
himself. This character may prefer the 
company of animals to that of people, 
as they do not respond to subterfuge.
A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL
Major, Story
The character has sold his soul to 
the devil and now ﬁnd himself des-
tined to infernal damnation. This 
Flaw includes the effects of Plagued 
By Supernatural Entity as Hell’s agents 
goad and cajole the character, remind-
ing him of the bargain he made and 
tempting him with offers of possible 
release in return for just one more 
small service. The character is called 
upon to undertake an inherently sin-
ful action, but the reward is always 
snatched away on some technicality 
of the agreement or simply because 


--- Page ---

Grogs
of the duplicitous nature of the infer-
nal. Note that the character can, in 
fact, repent and get out of the deal by 
God’s grace, but the repentance must 
be genuine, and the forces of Hell will 
try to stop it, thus generating stories 
that way.
DEVOTED PARENT/CHILD
Minor, General
The character is extremely at-
tached to a parent or child. Where 
he goes, she goes also. Separation of 
more than a day will cause anxiety, 
and will give a –1 penalty to all rolls 
due to stress.
THE FALLING EVIL
Major, General
The character occasionally suffers 
convulsions and blackouts. Convul-
sions occur randomly and infrequent-
ly; for any given event, the storyguide 
should secretly roll a stress die, and 
if the result is 9 or more then a con-
vulsion will occur at some point dur-
ing that event, as chosen by the sto-
ryguide. This spasm causes random 
movements and hallucinations, leav-
ing the character temporarily Incapac-
itated. She collapses to the ground and 
twitches, and you can make a Stamina 
roll against an Ease Factor of 9 every 
round; success means that the convul-
sion ends, although the character is re-
duced to the Dazed Fatigue level fol-
lowing a ﬁt. The Falling Evil is usually 
caused by possession by demons (Art & 
Academe, page 48), but that form of the 
illness is usually temporary in nature. 
The character does not seem to have a 
disease, and cannot naturally recover 
from this afﬂiction. It may be that it 
stems from a different source. In An-
cient Greece and Rome, it was called 
the “divine illness,” as it was believed 
that the gods spoke to those who had 
such ﬁts.
FLASHBACKS
Minor, General
When engaged in combat, or a 
similar violent and tense situation, the 
stress might trigger a ﬂashback to the 
horrors of past battles, which left this 
character mentally scarred. The hallu-
cinations seem so real that it is hard 
to avoid reacting to them. When an 
event appropriate for the Flashbacks 
occurs, roll a stress die against an Ease 
Factor of 9. On a failure, the charac-
ter panics and revert to his past night-
mares. At the storyguide’s discretion, 
modiﬁers from –1 to –5 could apply, 
for things like full-scale battle, ﬁres, 
or stampeding animals. In addition, 
add or subtract any relevant Personal-
ity Traits, depending on whether they 
might lessen or worsen the effects of 
this Flaw. 
Bear in mind that positive traits 
like loyal, reliable, law-abiding, or 
calm should be helpful in avoiding this 
afﬂiction. Similarly, negative traits like 
selﬁsh, angry, or corrupt subtract from 
the roll, making him more likely to 
succumb. Often, his actions hurt, em-
barrass, or offend comrades, employ-

ers, or other important people, and 
might have social repercussions. On 
a botch, he’ll get into real trouble — 
it could result in someone being seri-
ously hurt or killed, in valuables being 
broken or in him failing in his duty at 
a critical time. 
For magi, this Flaw should not in-
volve ﬂashbacks to Twilight episodes, 
spell botches or laboratory disasters. 
Since most of these situations won’t 
get worse by applying a penalty to the 
rest of the scene, it won’t be enough 
of a Flaw. But magi can be affected by 
combat, house ﬁres, or cave-ins just as 
much as other character types.
FISH OUT OF WATER (TERRAIN)
Minor, General
This character has an afﬁnity with 
one type of terrain, whether this is at 
sea, in the woods, the rolling hills, or 
in the urban landscape of towns and 
cities, and feels uncomfortable and 
awkward when away from where he 
wants to be. The character suffers a –1 
penalty to all stress rolls taken outside 
of their favored terrain and also rolls 
one more botch dice than normal in 
those situations.
Appropriate areas may be Cities 
& Towns, Villages, Rivers, The Sea, 
Mountains, Woodland, Desert, etc.
This Flaw may only be taken once, 
because taking it more than once 
makes it less serious, rather than more.
FOREIGN UPBRINGING
Minor, Personality
This Flaw is somewhat similar to 
Covenant Upbringing, but means that 
the character is a foreigner and comes 
from a remote or isolated corner of 
Mythic Europe. He appears and sound 
nothing like the locals, has odd cus-
toms, habits, and religion (although 
he need not be pagan), and is quite 
confused by local society. However, 
he is not an Outsider, and has been 
accepted — for the most part. His 
Native Language is one foreign to the 
saga, and he needs to learn another 
language in order to communicate 
with the rest of the turb. The maxi-
mum scores for locality-dependent 
Abilities like Language, Area Lore, or 
Organization Lore, as well as some so-
cial Abilities, are half (round up) that 
which his age normally allows.
GULLIBLE
Minor, Personality
There is one born every minute — 
and it is this character! He is an easy 
victim of ruses, stories and teasing lies. 
People lying to him get a bonus to 
their Guile rolls of +1 to +3. Depend-
ing on how bright or sharp-witted he 
is, he might not fall for obvious lies, 
denials of things that are evident or 
common knowledge. However, he 
most likely falls for lies that are even 
remotely plausible, and if he has no 
idea whether or not something is true, 
he is almost certain to believe it. This 
could, for instance, be whether or not 
there are mischievous faeries under 
the bridge. If you really want the char-
acter to not fall for something, make 
an Intelligence + Folk Ken Stress roll 
against an Ease Factor equal to the 
Communication + Guile roll of the 
person telling the tall tale. Recom-
mended modiﬁers to the Ease Fac-
tor are +0 for obvious lies (ones that 
someone without the Flaw would cer-
tainly not believe), +6 for outlandish 
tales and +9 for things which could 
be true, or lies told by someone in au-
thority, or who has expert knowledge 
of the subject at hand.
HALLUCINATIONS
Minor, General
The character is afﬂicted by vivid 
hallucinations which seem to be true 
visions, but rather than coming from 
a higher power, they are ﬁgments of 
her imagination and fantasy. She ﬁnds 
these visions particularly troublesome, 
and seeks meaning in them where 
there is none to be had. Coincidence 
might mean that some part of her hal-
lucinations comes to pass, which only 
furthers her belief that there is mean-
ing within them. If the character also 
has the Visions Flaw, then some of her 
visions are true, but most of them are 
meaningless jumbles of nonsense gen-
erated from within her mind.
IMAGINED FOLK  
TRADITION VULNERABILITY
Minor, Personality
Although this ﬂaw closely re-
sembles a Delusion, Imagined Folk 
Tradition Vulnerability has other 
game mechanical effects as well. This 
character utterly and sincerely be-
lieves that he has been touched by 
the fay, and that they have granted 
him his special skills — whether or 
not any such exist. So, naturally, he 
is convinced that he is as vulnerable 
to traditional wards and folk magic as 
the fey. Whenever there is talk about 
such folk remedies, or people around 
him try to perform them, he does his 
best to dissuade them. If he can get 
away with it, he removes or sabotage 
such wards; for instance, he sneaks 
around at night and removes any 
warding marks or materials at door-
ways. Finally, he exhibits strange be-
havior around active wards or ritualis-
tic actions. This could be refusing to 
shake hands with a person right after 
they have drawn the sign of the cross, 
or ﬂinching whenever salt is ﬂung 
over someone’s shoulder. On the plus 
side, this Flaw allows the character to 
purchase a score of 1 (but no more) in 
Faerie Lore at character creation. This 
is because he needs a rudimentary 
knowledge of the fay and the wards 
against them in order to be able to act

Grogs
this way. Without such knowledge, 
his behavior is based on what he thinks 
such wards might be.
INDEPENDENT CRAFTSMAN
Minor, General
This character has his own way of 
working and doesn’t like other people 
getting in his way. This character al-
ways treats his Leadership and Craft 
or Profession Abilities as three levels 
lower when working with others on a 
given task. For Craftsmen, this means 
that whether he is working as an as-
sistant or working with assistants his 
Craft Ability has a penalty of –3. This 
affects the number of assistants he can 
employ in the workshop and the ben-
eﬁt that he provides when working as 
an assistant.
JINXED
Minor, General
The character is a magnet for any 
bad luck. He is not personally the cause 
of the bad luck, and so need not roll 
any extra botch dice or suffer any pen-
alty to die rolls. However, whenever 
chance determines who will be affect-
ed by misfortune, the odds are biased 
against him to be the one affected. For 
example, if it has been determined that 
a rope used for climbing will break, it 
is more likely to do so when the jin-
xed character makes the climb. If de-
termining when the bandits will attack 
the camp at night, it is more likely to 
happen right at the moment when the 
character is relieving himself. If the 
storyguide is rolling dice to determine 
the target of a random event, a jinxed 
character should be affected half of 
the time, and his comrades between 
them the other half. His bad luck does 
not tend to spill over onto others; in 
fact, other characters may prefer to 
keep him around to deﬂect any bad 
luck from themselves.
LINGERING INJURY
Minor, General
The character suffers from an old 
injury that won’t heal properly, re-
sulting in a –1 penalty to all rolls in-
volving physical activity. If he botch-
es a physical action, he aggravates 
the injury and the penalty becomes 
–3 (recovery from aggravation is as 
for a Light Wound). This condition 
worsens with age, so multiply what-
ever the penalty is by 1 + (Decrepi-
tude Score).
MAGICAL FASCINATION
Minor, Personality
This character is intensely inter-
ested in supernatural and magical phe-
nomena, to the exclusion of all other 
motivations. It is as if his life is hollow 
and drab without these experiences. 
He will involve himself in any super-
natural investigation, social encoun-
ter, or confrontation. He must try and 
ﬁnd out as much as he can about it, 
and he is curious and has busy hands, 
deﬁnitely trying to take souvenirs. To 
represent the scraps of knowledge he 
has, he is allowed to have a score of 1 
(but no more) in either Magic or Faer-
ie Lore at character creation. But most 
of the time, he is ﬁlling in the blanks 
himself and making it up as he goes 
along, enthusiastically.
MANIFEST SIN
Minor, Supernatural
A sin or crime this character has 
committed in the past stains his spirit 
and is manifest to those who can per-
ceive things hidden to mortal senses. 
Characters with Second Sight, Sense 
Holiness & Unholiness, or similar 
Supernatural Powers or Abilities per-
ceive the sin through one or more 
senses. See ArM5, page 67, for these 
Abilities.
The manifestation of the sin or 
crime should be chosen by you and 
the storyguide together, and should 
always be appropriate to the sin or 
crime in question. For instance, the 
perpetrator of a violent crime may 
appear to have blood on his hands, 
or be accompanied by the sobbing of 
his victim, while lustful sins may be 
seen to play across the sinner’s leer-
ing face.
In addition, the character suffer 
a –1 penalty to all social interaction 
rolls or totals as the intangible aura of 
their past sins affects those with whom 
they interact.
While his spirit is tainted and the 
manifestation will always be with him, 
he may spend a Faith Point, including 
Faith Points gained from taking Holy 
Communion and from relics, to ban-
ish the manifestation for Sun dura-
tion. While banished, the sin cannot 
be perceived and the social penalty is 
also suspended.
This Flaw originates from either 
the Divine or the Infernal Realm, as 
a mark of punishment, penitence, or 
temptation.
MASTER OF NONE
Minor, General
Either by choice or circumstance, 
this character never seems to be able 
to stick at a task or job for longer 
than a season, usually following the 
work as it moves through the year. As 
a result, this character can’t apply any 
experience points earned to an Abil-
ity or Art that they have already ap-
plied experience points to this year. 
Where they can’t be applied to a dif-
ferent Ability or Art, the experience 
points are lost.
Experience points gained through 
other virtues, such as Secondary In-
sight, are unaffected and may be ap-
plied normally.

NECESSARY (REALM) AURA  
FOR (ABILITY)
Minor, Supernatural
Due to some connection with a 
given supernatural realm, the absence 
of a given supernatural aura has a pro-
nounced effect upon the character’s 
ability to focus on certain tasks. The 
character has a –3 penalty to any to-
tals he generates with a particular 
Ability when not in the right aura. 
A character may take this Flaw once 
for any particular Ability. The chosen 
Ability should be one which the char-
acter is likely to use frequently, such 
as in service to the covenant or to sup-
port his day-to-day activities.
When applied to Craft or Profes-
sion Abilities, this Flaw also reduces 
the character’s capability to support 
himself by reducing the number of La-
bor Points he accumulates each season 
when not working within the appro-
priate aura.
Troupes should think carefully 
about how a character would be lim-
ited by taking Magic (which covers 
most covenants) or Dominion (which 
covers most other human settle-
ments) aura. If the character would 
not be limited, the Flaw should not 
be allowed.
NIGHT TERRORS
Minor, General
This character is plagued far too 
often by horrible nightmares and ﬁts 
of screaming in his sleep. The char-
acter must make a Stress Roll against 
an Ease Factor of 9 in order to avoid 
suffering terrors. The storyguide may 
call for modiﬁers of –1 to –3 if he has 
faced eerie or terrifying events recent-
ly, like meeting a demon or battling 
the undead.
Suffering from terrors means that 
the character wakes up often and in 
a panic during the night. Situations 
might occur where he overreacts or 
reacts in unfortunate ways, if forced 
awake during such nights. The morn-
ing leaves him with a Long Term Fa-
tigue Level lost. These Long Term 
Fatigue Levels are cumulative, so 
several bad nights leave him in bad 
shape. Subtract the character’s Fatigue 
penalty from the Ease Factor to avoid 
night terrors, to represent how a truly 
exhausted victim will at some point 
sleep through the nightmares due to 
sheer exhaustion. If a night of terrors 
renders the character Unconscious, he 
slips into deep, dreamless sleep. He 
sleeps for an entire day and night, and 
wakes up at Winded, ending the string 
of Night Terrors. A character with this 
Flaw may not also take the Sleep Dis-
order Flaw
This Flaw normally makes seasonal 
Laboratory work impossible, and so is 
not suitable for magi.
PACK MENTALITY
Minor, Personality
The character is a follower, not a 
leader. He rarely takes the initiative, 
but is usually happy to follow the di-
rection of a forthright and decisive 
person. If he ﬁnds a leader, he tends to 
stick with him.
PAGAN
Major, Story
Your character is a devout pagan, 
which disturbs powerful people in 
Mythic Europe. He avoids church-
men, and cannot pass as a Christian 
because he believes to do so will in-
vite retribution from his gods. He 
may have either Magic Lore or Fa-
erie Lore, depending on precisely 
who he worships. This is not a Flaw 
in those parts of the Novgorod Tri-
bunal where pagans are still common. 
Note that you do not need this Flaw

83
Grogs
to have a pagan character; only if he 
refuses to deny his pagan nature does 
this generate stories.
Grogs may not take Major Story 
Flaws. This Virtue is repeated here to 
aid the design of companions. It is not 
compulsory for time-lost characters 
(see Chapter 7, Grog Templates), but 
suits many. A fuller description ap-
pears in Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, 
page 109.
POOR LIVING CONDITIONS
Minor, General
Either because of this character’s 
own poor living conditions, or those 
of people he is in frequent contact 
with, he is more susceptible to the 
rigors of daily life. The character has 
an additional –1 Living Conditions 
Modiﬁer. This is cumulative with the 
character’s base Living Conditions 
Modiﬁer, as per ArM5, page 170.
PRIMITIVE EQUIPMENT
Minor, General
The character is capable of using 
only the simplest tools and equip-
ment. Perhaps her training was in-
complete, or she has been affected 
by some sort of curse, or maybe she 
originates from a less technologi-
cally-capable society and refuses to 
adapt. She is restricted to Inexpen-
sive weapons and armor only, regard-
less of what is made available to her. 
If forced by order or necessity to use 
other equipment, her Burden is one 
point higher when she uses anything 
other than Inexpensive weapons, and 
one point higher when she uses any-
thing other than Inexpensive armor. 
She suffers a –1 penalty to Attack and 
Defense if using inappropriate weap-
ons, and a –1 penalty to Initiative and 
Protection if using inappropriate ar-
mor. If the character works as a labor-
er or craftsman, she uses simple tools 
and primitive procedures. Unless 
working with simple tasks, the base 
Craft Value (see City & Guild, page 67) 
is raised by 1–3 at the storyguide’s 
discretion, based on complexity. Fur-
ther, her workshop may not be im-
proved with regards to Innovation 
(City & Guild, page 65). Other Profes-
sion Abilities dependent on tools and 
equipment suffer a similar penalty for 
complex tasks. You should only take 
this Flaw if the character belongs to 
a profession that relies heavily on 
equipment, such as a smith, mason, 
or soldier.
RAISED IN THE GUTTER
Minor, General
This character was raised on the 
margins of society. She is able to 
use her social abilities normally with 
those of the lower and middle classes, 
but doesn’t know how to act among 
her “betters.” When using Charm or 
Guile, it is obvious that she’s from the 
bad part of town, and this makes con-
vincing people to do what she wants 
harder (–3 on rolls). She can use Eti-
quette normally if she’s holding her 
social place (which means staying si-
lent and doing exactly what she’s told) 
but suffers a –3 penalty if she tries to 
go beyond this.
(REALM) STIGMATIC
Minor, Supernatural
The character occasionally mani-
fests physical phenomena in the pres-
ence of supernatural powers. Pick one 
of the four Realms of Power; whenever 
he enters an aura of strength 4 or more 
aligned to that realm, or is affected by 
a power greater than fourth magnitude 
(20th level) from that realm, he suffers 
from the stigmata. Every individual 
suffers from stigmata differently, but 
the most common variants are dark 
marks appearing on the skin, blood 
issuing from oriﬁces, spontaneous 
eruption of wounds, minor twisting of 
the limbs, or the acquisition of minor 
animal features. Whenever they mani-
fest, the character loses a Long-Term 
Fatigue level that he cannot recover 
while he remains under the inﬂuence 
of that Realm. When he recovers the 
Fatigue level, the stigmata fades. If he 
ever takes a Warping point from ex-
posure to his sensitive Realm, his stig-
mata erupt so violently that he takes a 
Light Wound as well as Fatigue, and 
the stigmata remain until he recovers 
from this wound.
RESTRICTED LEARNING
Minor, General
The character is incapable of 
learning new things without assis-
tance. Pick ﬁve Abilities at character 
creation; you can only apply experi-
ence points to these Abilities. The 
character cannot learn any new Abili-
ties on her own; she must receive 
experience points from Teaching or 
Training to develop a new Ability or 
to improve one that is not part of the 
initial ﬁve. Furthermore, she cannot 
use an Ability with no score, even if it 
can normally be used untrained. Any 
Supernatural Abilities from Virtues 
she possesses are added to the list of 
Abilities to which she can apply expe-
rience points. All mundane animals are 
required to take this Flaw.
ROLLING STONE
Minor, General
The rolling stone gathers no 
moss, and neither does this character. 
She has moved from village to village 
so often that she ﬁnds it difﬁcult to 
create attachments in the communi-
ty. All social rolls have a –1 penalty 
within the community.

SAVANTISM
Minor, General
The character’s family was cursed 
by faeries; his mother tripped over a 
hare while pregnant with him; or he 
was born on horseback. He is physi-
cally capable, but simple-minded and 
slow-witted. He has half the stan-
dard experience points at character 
generation, all future Advancement 
Totals are halved, and he may not 
begin with an Ability above 3. How-
ever, with one favored Ability, he is 
exceptionally gifted. This Ability 
can improve normally, is limited to a 
score of 6 as a starting character, and 
has +3 to all rolls related to its spe-
cialization rather than just +1. The 
Ability must be something he could 
reasonably have access to learn; there 
would need to be an extraordinary 
background story for a savant who is 
a master of the longsword! 
Most savants will be like the tragic 
fool whose precocious skill with horses 
has gone forever unnoticed, but some 
may have more esoteric talents. If the 
favored Ability requires a Virtue, such 
as Academic or Martial Abilities, then 
he must have that Virtue as normal; a 
mathematical savant would need Edu-
cated to learn Artes Liberales. Magi 
may well desire the company of cer-
tain specialists: a Jerbiton maga would 
appreciate an artistic savant, for exam-
ple. Similarly, a Failed Apprentice may 
have been left stricken with savantism 
when his Gift abandoned him, but 
he retained remarkable clarity on the 
Code of Hermes, becoming a valued 
clerk to a Quaesitor.
SLEEP DISORDER
Minor, General
More often than not, this charac-
ter is unable to sleep soundly during 
the night. The resulting deprivation 
means that he is likely to nod off in 
periods of quiet and boredom. When 
the character is alone, comfortable, 
bored, or otherwise at risk of falling 
asleep, he needs to make a suitable 
Personality roll to avoid nodding off. 
Loyal, Reliable, and Lazy (for a pen-
alty in the last case) are all appropri-
ate. The character’s current Fatigue 
penalty applies to the roll. 
Regardless of whether he man-
ages to stay awake, the following 
night you must make a stress roll 
(no botch) against an Ease Factor of 
6 to see if the character sleeps well. 
Every night he has slept poorly, he 
loses a Long Term Fatigue Level. 
Continue this until he sleeps soundly 
for a whole night. Once he has lost 
3 Long Term Fatigue Levels, he au-
tomatically sleeps through the night, 
due to sheer exhaustion. This Flaw is 
not compatible with the Night Ter-
rors Flaw.
STUCK IN HIS WAYS
Minor, General
Having come from a covenant, this 
character knows how things must be 
done to best serve the needs of coven-
folk and magi alike. Only, his new 
home does things differently. And 
they’re wrong. When making Stress 
Rolls against his Profession Abilities or 
any Ability concerning his new cov-
enant, such as Leadership or Folk Ken, 
this character uses the lower of that 
Ability score and his current Covenant 
Lore Ability for his current covenant. 
Note that bonuses from Puissance or 
other Virtues still apply to the roll.
This Flaw can also be applied to 
organizations other than covenants, 
such as abbeys, universities, guilds, or 
churches.
SUSCEPTIBLE TO WARPING
Minor, Supernatural
Your character’s constant exposure 
to magic at the side of his magus has 
made him more susceptible to super-
natural Warping than he might other-
wise be.
In any year in which the charac-
ter gains a Warping Point from any 
Realm or any source (including Lon-
gevity Rituals, living within an aura, 
and powerful supernatural effects), the 
character gains one additional Warp-
ing Point associated with that same 
Realm. This means that if he gains a 
single Warping Point from each Realm 
in a year, he gains four additional 
Warping Points, one from each Realm, 
at the end of that year.
These additional points do not 
contribute to Wizard’s Twilight or to 
other events caused by the acquisi-
tion of Warping Points as they accrete 
slowly over the course of the year.
UNCERTAIN FAITH
Minor, General
Whether through a ﬂaw in the 
character’s understanding of doc-
trine, a moral turmoil, the disheart-
ening absolution of repeated sins, or 
exposure to conﬂicting philosophies, 
he ﬁnds it hard to fully express de-
votion to his faith. Some element of 
doubt stands between him and the 
Divine, and all rolls for holy inﬂu-
ence, tempering an aura, invoking 
God’s aid, or invoking a saint or 
baraka (see Realms of Power: The Divine) 
suffer a –3 penalty.
The character also has an “Un-
certain Faith” Personality Trait at +1 
that describes this conﬂict or doubt, 
which always provides demons with 
an opportunity to sow further doubt 
through their Obsession power (Realms 
of Power: The Infernal, page 31).
Supernatural Abilities originating 
from the Divine, including Methods 
and Powers, are not penalized. This 
Flaw is not compatible with the True 
Faith Virtue.

UNCONTROLLABLE STRENGTH
Minor, General
This character doesn’t know his 
own strength, and at times he has 
trouble controlling it. This Flaw may 
not be taken if the character’s Strength 
is below 0. Whenever he handles deli-
cate or fragile objects, whenever care 
must be taken to knock somebody out 
gently, and so on, he risks overdoing 
it, severely. The character must make 
a stress roll against an Ease Factor of 
6 to avoid using too much power and 
causing damage of some kind. In addi-
tion to this, any Strength Stress Roll 
uses one extra botch die.
UNINSPIRATIONAL
Minor, General
This character is bland, boring, and 
simple, with almost no chance of ever 
getting noticed or enticing anyone. 
His Presence and Communication 
may not be greater than 0. Any use of 
Abilities like Leadership, Charm, In-
trigue, Etiquette or similar — as well 
as Personality Rolls — to stir or im-
press people suffers a –3 penalty.
UNLUCKY
Minor, General
The character is exceptionally un-
lucky, and is frequently dealt a bad 
hand by the forces of chance. He gets 
a –1 to –3 penalty (at storyguide’s dis-
cretion) on rolls in situations based on 
luck rather than skill or talent, depend-
ing on how much luck is involved. It 
would be wise for him not to take part 
in games of chance.
UNSPECIALIZED
Minor, General
The character does not have any 
specialties for any of her Abilities.
VIATICARUS
Minor, Supernatural
At some point in the character’s 
past, he was at death’s door, and as 
a result a priest performed the sacra-
ment of Extreme Unction. The pur-
pose of this sacrament was to remit 
him of all venial sins, and prepare 
him for the journey beyond (the vi-
aticum); but against all expectations, 
he survived. This leaves him in a 
spiritual no-man’s land, not one of 
the dead, but neither wholly of the 
living. Because of this, he is immune 
to the temptations of demons, and 
therefore cannot be affected by their 
Obsession power; he simply does not 
register to them as a soul in need of 
corruption. However, his skin has an 
unusual pallor, and his eyes are sunk-
en. People may smell a charnel odor 
about him. These effects are subtle 
at ﬁrst, but as he ages, he gradually 
comes to resemble a corpse more and 
more, resulting in a penalty to all so-
cial interaction rolls equal to his De-
crepitude score. 
He has difﬁculty crossing thresh-
olds where unquiet spirits are not wel-
come; if a person with a (Realm) Lore 
of 1 or more has set up a traditional 
ward, such as a line of salt or an iron 
nail laid on the lintel, then he cannot 
enter the protected building or area. 
Further, although he does not have 
a Might score, he is repulsed by any 
magical warding that can keep out a 
creature with a Might score aligned to 
Corpus or Mentem (including the Ae-
gis of the Hearth), regardless of its level 
or Penetration. However, both types 
of exclusion can be negated if he is 
invited to cross by the person who es-
tablished the ward, or someone who 
lives within. He can still touch indi-
viduals with Magic Resistance, since 
he has no active power around him.
If the character’s status is known 
in the community in which he lives, 
he should take the Outcast Social 
Status Flaw.
WARPED BY MAGIC
Minor, Supernatural
The character’s adventures have 
exposed him to powerful magical 
forces that have left a mark on him. 
He has ﬁve Warping Points and a 
Warping Score of 1, including a Mi-
nor Flaw (which is not balanced by 
a Virtue) that somehow reﬂects the 
source of the Warping. His encoun-
ters allow you to spend experience 
points on Magic Lore during charac-
ter creation. A magus may take this 
ﬂaw to represent Warping gained 
before his apprenticeship. With the 
permission of the troupe, this Flaw 
may be modiﬁed to represent Warp-
ing from other Realms.
WEAK PERSONALITY
Minor, Personality
This 
character 
doesn’t 
feel 
strongly for or against anything and 
lacks the unique traits most people 
have to make them really stand out. 
Consequently, all Personality Traits 
must be between +1 and –1. When 
making personality rolls, treat any 
roll above 6 as merely 6. The char-
acter may have no other Personal-
ity Flaws or Virtues or Flaws that 
grant Personality Traits. Depending 
on the personality of the observer, 
he may seem a complete pushover 
with no opinion of his own, insensi-
tive because he rarely shows strong 
emotion, or simply lacking in initia-
tive to those seeking leadership and 
guidance. These elements result in a 
–1 or worse (at the Storyguide’s dis-
cretion) modiﬁer in most social situ-
ations for obviously being a cold ﬁsh. 
Finally, he will never be known for 
his great loyalty or pious nature, and 
will have a hard time winning respect 
or getting promoted. His lack of en-
thusiasm for the Church in particular 
might be viewed as a lack of faith. 
On the plus side, he might occasion-

he never disagrees strongly.
WORTHLESS ABILITIES
Minor, General
A time-lost character (see Chapter 
7: Grog Templates) must have about 
30 experience points that have been 
rendered valueless by her shift in 
time. For example, she may have Area 
Lore of 3 for a city that no longer ex-
ists, or her Etiquette score may have 
been rendered useless by changing 
social structures. Troupes may per-
mit companions to purchase this Flaw 
multiple times.
In the example of the legionar-
ies given in the Time-lost Witnesses 
template (see Chapter 7), their wast-
ed ability is their Organization Lore. 
The army to which it refers no lon-
ger exists.

This chapter contains many sug-
gested backgrounds for grogs, in-
cluding suggested Virtues and Flaws 
and fully worked-out Abilities at 
three different ages, to help players 
create a wide range of grogs quickly 
and easily.
The Advisor
My lord, if I may, the magus Bellato-
rius is reputed to be a man not given to ei-
ther forgiveness or forgetfulness. If you really 
must challenge someone to certamen, perhaps 
Benedic ex Miscellanea might make for a less 
resentful target.
This specialist within the covenant 
has found a niche for himself by learn-
ing all he can about his covenant, the 
Order of Hermes, and the supernatu-
ral realms with which his masters so 
frequently come into contact. This 
encyclopedic knowledge of the world 
in which his magi operate makes him 
an essential companion to the more 
cloistered magi.
General Background
He may have been a failed monk 
or student, or simply an educated man 
who fell upon the secrets of the mysti-
cal world by chance. With few prac-
tical skills, he is left to make a living 
from his mind. A brush with the Order 
of Hermes early in his life could have 
opened his eyes to a world beyond the 
mundane; perhaps he was the son of 
a notary who visited a covenant, or a 
student intrigued by the strange be-
havior of his tutor.
He researched everything he could 
about the Order of Hermes, learning 
things that others tend to ignore. And 
then he identiﬁed a covenant. He was 
probably able to identify several from 
the letters and journals he found, and 
chose the one that best suited his per-
sonality. From there, he worked his 
way into the covenfolk, becoming an 
uninvited ﬁxture.
The Advisor is most likely the con-
stant companion to one particular ma-
gus. Just as the more adventurous ma-
gus may have a favored shield grog, so 
the more political magus may take a 
weapon of another kind: knowledge. 
The Advisor specializes in some key 
Abilities of use to a magus, and in do-
ing so he frees his magus from having 
to develop those skills himself.
But this has a cost. The position is 
high-proﬁle, the Advisor never being 
far from his magus, and costly. The 
Advisor must be maintained in a man-
ner as beﬁts both him and the magus. 
This may include creating Longevity 
Rituals for the Advisor, or enchanted 
items, or simply ensuring that he is 
dressed in appropriate ﬁnery.
The Advisor most likely attends 
his master on all matters of business, 
including Tribunals and covenant 
councils. Others may object to this, 
unless the covenant or Tribunal de-
velops a culture of allowing such at-
tendants, and this may be a source 
of friction.
Grog Templates
Chapter Seven
The Role of the Advisor as Grog
Given that the Advisor is ever-
present, serving his master in mat-
ters political and supernatural, it is 
easy to assume that the character 
may take on a more important role 
within the game than his status as a 
grog might suggest. There are two 
ways to approach this. The ﬁrst is 
to assume that, like other grogs, the 
Advisor is a tool to be used by the 
magus when going about his busi-
ness. Most magi recognize their fail-
ings with things martial, and employ 
sentries and bodyguards to ensure 
their safety. Others have little time 
or aptitude for politics, and enjoy 
the protection afforded by a con-
stant Advisor. In game terms, invest-
ing in an Advisor allows the magus 
character to ignore certain Abilities 
in the knowledge that a grog will 
serve that function.
The second way of approaching 
the Advisor as grog is to simply ac-
cept that the character may one day 
grow in importance and become a 
companion in its own right. Guide-
lines on advancing characters from 
the grog status to companion can be 
found in Chapter 5.

Grogs
These advisors may be seen as the 
start of a courtier tradition within 
the Order of Hermes and magi may 
soon take to maintaining their own 
court of advisors, each with a given 
speciality.
Character Creation
The following notes provide help 
on creating an Advisor character.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
The Custos Virtue grants access 
to Arcane Abilities (see later), which 
means that the Advisor must have lived 
at a covenant long enough to have 
demonstrated his ability and worth. 
He is educated and so must be old 
enough to have learned at least Latin 
and Artes Liberales. In later years his 
master or masters are likely to develop 
a Longevity Ritual for him, so he can 
reach a considerable age, with Ability 
scores to match.
The Advisor is inclined to the 
mental 
Characteristics, 
not 
the 
physical ones. By assigning –1 to 
each of the four physical Character-
istics, scores of +3, +2, +1, and +1 
are available to assign to the mental 
Characteristics. Intelligence should 
be the highest Characteristic, and +2 
could be applied to Perception for a 
more-watchful Advisor, or Commu-
nication for a messenger, herald, or 
ambassador.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Virtues and Flaws for Advisors are: 
Custos; Educated, Puissant Order of 
Hermes Lore; Ability Block (Martial), 
Small Frame, Susceptible to Warping*
* See Chapter 6: New Virtues and Flaws
Advisor to a magus is an honored 
and respected position, so Custos is 
the appropriate Social Status Virtue. 
This allows the grog access to the 
Arcane Abilities that he will ﬁnd use-
ful to complement his master’s own 
knowledge. He is also Educated, as 
per the Virtue, which represents the 
classical tuition he received during his 
early years.
The last Virtue is Puissant Or-
der of Hermes Lore. The character 
has a knack for retaining information 
learned about his master’s House, Tri-
bunal, allies, and enemies.
The Advisor is not physically in-
clined. He has no aptitude for martial 
pursuits and is more vulnerable than 
most, due to his Small Frame.
While the Virtues are almost es-
sential to the Advisor, the Flaws are 
much more open and you should 
choose those that ﬁt your own Ad-
visor. He may be Tainted with Evil, 
explaining why he needs the security 
of the covenant. Or his many years of 
academic work may have given him 
Weak Characteristics.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Lacking in martial prowess, the 
Advisor relies upon his fastidious 
memory to show his value to his mas-
ters. The main abilities of note are 
the Art of Memory Ability (as pre-
sented in The Mysteries Revised Edition, 
page 25), used to recall details that 
his master may ﬁnd useful at a later 
date, and Order of Hermes Lore. 
This latter Ability allows the Advisor 
to advise his master as to the names 
of magi he is about to meet, remind 
him of dealings with other covenants 
that he is about to encounter at Tri-
bunal, and to steer him the right way 
in protocol. This is supplemented by 
a growing knowledge of the Code of 
Hermes, likely gained through the 
experience of keeping his master out 
of trouble.

The Ability scores earlier take into 
account the extra experience points 
granted by the Educated Virtue.
PERSONALITY TRAITS  
& REPUTATION
The ideal Advisor is Loyal above 
all else, and must be Dependable. His 
third trait is more open to choice: he 
could be Analytical, a Perfectionist, or 
be gifted with a Wry Humor. 
Regardless, the Advisor is most 
likely a long-suffering companion 
tasked with providing the answer his 
master needs at just the right time, and 
the Personality Traits earlier help rein-
force that outlook.
As he continues in service, he may 
gain his own reputation, separate 
from his master. This is especially true 
where he is tasked with looking after 
a young, inexperienced magus prone 
to mistakes.
Advisor Story Seeds
The following story seeds use 
the Advisor as a hook into situations 
that the magi and their companions 
must resolve.
POISONED
The Tribunal meets and the Ad-
visor lies dying, poisoned by a non-
Hermetic potion seemingly resistant 
to the simple healing spells. Some of 
the magi race to ﬁnd a cure for the 
poison while keeping the Advisor’s 
condition secret from their enemies. 
The others must conduct Tribunal 
business and discover the would-be 
assassin, all without the one man 
they have come to rely on.
AN UNEXPECTED ADVISOR
Nobody is entirely sure how 
long he has been at the covenant, 
who his parents were, or how he 
came to know so much, but the 
reserved and conﬁdent young man 
was right. Investigating the young 
man’s reasoning and examining his 
information proves it: that trouble 
with the Church was stirred up by 
a Tytalus known to the covenant. 
How had this young man spotted 
what is now so obvious when all 
the magi of the covenant failed? 
What are they going to do with 
their unexpected benefactor? And 
what are they going to do about 
the Tytalus? Their new Advisor 
may have an idea …
ESPIONAGE
The Advisor has gone missing. 
He was not seen to leave, and both 
his chamber and ofﬁce have been 
magically cleansed of any Arcane 
Connections to him.
A week later, a redcap inquires 
after him, and then reveals that she 
may have seen him, ﬂeetingly, at an-
other covenant. She got a sense that 
she’d seen something she shouldn’t 
have. Did this other covenant steal 
him away? How and why?

Grogs
Advisor as Companion
The Advisor archetype lends itself 
to the companion category quite eas-
ily. Given the increased capacity for 
Virtues and Flaws, the companion can 
gain additional starting experience 
points to increase his Ability scores, 
and take supernatural abilities such 
as Second Sight that further increase 
his involvement in stories. The com-
panion can also take Story Flaws that 
draw him and his masters into ongo-
ing trouble and can set up moments of 
crisis where his loyalty is tested.
The 
Almogavars
Desperta Ferras! (Awake the Iron!)
 
 
— Battle cry of the Almogavars
General Background
The Almogavars are a special type 
of mercenary unit from Iberia, em-
ployed in vast numbers in the Chris-
tian north. Renowned for their fearless 
ferocity, they are frontiersmen as well 
as soldiers, and are tied to neither land 
nor liege. They wander in search of ad-
venture, selling their services as mer-
cenaries or engaging in their own raids 
into Muslim territory. They are often 
employed by towns, nobles, clergy, 
and kings. In Mythic Iberia, magi of 
the Order of Hermes rely upon them 
as well. The peninsula is a dangerous 
place, and even the most peaceful of 
covenants have need of some sort of 
protection. It is also possible to hire 
Almogavars to work in locations other 
than Iberia, and this description can 
be used as a template for other merce-
nary units as well. 
Almogavar comes from the Ara-
bic al-mogàuar, meaning “raider” or 
“devastator.” Though this is accurate, 
they are also known for charity and 
generosity. For example, after raid-
ing a wealthy Muslim estate, they 
may give a portion of the spoils to 
the poor. Despite their coarse ap-
pearance, Almogavars live by a code 
of honor and military discipline. If 
treated well and given respect, they 
are both loyal and dutiful. But if 
abused or mistreated (or not paid), 
they are known to seek revenge or 
simply take what they are due.
Almogavars originated in the Ara-
gonese Pyrenees as bands of shep-
herds resisting Moslem incursion. 
Prospering as raiders and paid mili-
tia, Almogavar culture rapidly spread 
throughout Iberia. Their ranks are 
open to all, including men from Ara-
gon, Catalonia, Castile, and other 
regions. They even accept Basques, 
Mozarabs (Arabized Christians), and 
runaway slaves from Muslim lands. 
All they require is submission to their 
code. This freewheeling lifestyle may 
seem attractive to those ostracized by 
society, such as Jews, foreigners, des-
peradoes, and those with a Magical 
Air or The Gift. They still have to deal 
with a certain amount of suspicion at 
ﬁrst, but in time they are able to earn 
trust and respect that is not possible in 
most social settings.
Almogavars are willing to work 
for unusual employers, such as magi. 
Covenants hire them to supplement 
their grogs, and some wizards have a 
small unit as a personal retinue. Magi 
employing Almogavars should be 
mindful how they treat them. Some 
magi are accustomed to pushing their 
underlings around, threatening them, 
and using magical punishment. Almo-
gavars are prideful and independent, 
and don’t take lightly to threats. Magi-
cal interference with their code of dis-
cipline is seen as a great offense.
A typical band of Almogavars con-
sists of around a dozen men, guided 
by an Adalil (sergeant) and led by 
an Almogaten (captain). Leaders are 
chosen from the ranks according to 
merit, and this familiarity and person-
al loyalty creates a close-knit and co-
hesive unit. When large numbers are 
involved, command might be delegat-
ed to a knight (or magus), and they 
occasionally form alliances to gain a 
mantle of legitimacy.
Almogavars are a form of elite in-
fantry, considered equal to or better 
than the light cavalry of the Moors, 
and are employed in both skirmishes 
and full assaults. They favor light ar-
The Vibria Company
Originally from Barcelona, the 
Vibria Company made their early 
fortunes in employment with the 
Jerbiton magi who dwell there, then 
later with other magi of the Order. 
In the Catalan tongue, a vibria is a 
type of dragon (a wyvern), and the 
name is meant to subtly advertise 
to their preferred clientele. Each 
member has the new Virtue of Her-
metic Experience, and are all veter-
ans at least 30 years old. They spe-
cialize in Hermetic clientele, and 
like the Monjoie Company, they 
accept payment in vis, which they 
use to barter for enchanted items 
and longevity. They are hired out 
as small teams of specialists, and 
they have multiple units deployed 
in different tribunals. For example, 
the Red Wyverns are located in 
the Stonehenge Tribunal, and the 
Draco Negra Division is in Rome. 
These remote groups take in local 
recruits, so regional units may carry 
variant armaments and have differ-
ent customs, but they still adhere to 
the same code.

Grogs
mor, typically wearing sheepskins and 
heavy leather sandals with an open-
faced helmet. Their primary weapon 
is the Azcona, a short, light lance 
that can be used as a spear or a jav-
elin, and they carry a short sword for 
close-quarters combat. Almogavars 
prefer lightweight mobility and carry 
few supplies, provisioning themselves 
by foraging and raiding. This allows 
them to make incursions into enemy 
territory at greater speed and for a 
greater distance than cavalry. Leaders 
sometimes ride on horseback, but pre-
fer ﬁghting on foot.
In combat, Almogavars utilize in-
novative and unconventional tactics. 
Against cavalry, they throw their 
spears at the enemy’s horses, and once 
unhorsed, the riders are easy prey for 
the expert infantry. On the rare occa-
sion that an Almogavar ﬁghts on horse-
back, he braces his spear in his stirrup, 
aiming to strike the enemy’s mount. 
They exploit the terrain to their best 
advantage, even preparing the battle-
ﬁeld by wetting the ground or scatter-
ing sharp stones. Stealth and surprise 
are also favored tactics, and they often 
attack at night and set up ambushes. 
Almogavars are also known to employ 
fear and awe to frighten an enemy and 
weaken their morale. Facing a foe be-
fore battle, they strike their weapons 
against rocks to create sparks as they 
howl a chant to “Awake the Iron.”
Alongside 
magi, 
Almogavars 
quickly adapt to the use of magic in 
battle. Their irregular and inventive 
tactics blend well with the many un-
usual and unexpected applications of 
wizardry. If a magus has no combat 
experience, they may suggest ideas 
for him. Magic could be used to al-
ter the terrain, set traps, or frighten 
and disorient the enemy. Even an 
experienced martial magus can ben-
eﬁt from their experience, and they 
can advise them as how to best target 
their spells. However, once they gain 
familiarity with the supernatural and 
learn the limits of magic, they might 
be able to devise strategies that can 
defeat a magus.
Recruiting Almogavars can be 
done through a companion or some 
agent, and some magi have contacts 
of their own. It is easy to ﬁnd com-
mon rabble willing to sell their sword 
arms. The hard part is ﬁnding soldiers 
Almogavar Story Seeds
These story seeds can bring Al-
mogavars into the saga.
ALTERING THE BARGAIN
Embarking on a dangerous ex-
pedition, the magi decide to hire 
some extra protection. They meet 
an Almogaten named Jabier, who 
has experience dealing with magi 
and knows the area well. However, 
he has ulterior motives and desires 
wizardly assistance against his ene-
mies. Hiring or bribing a magus isn’t 
an option. He shudders to imagine 
what price a wizard would charge, 
and most of all, he doesn’t want 
the magi to know what he’s up to. 
Instead, he plans to manipulate the 
magi into accomplishing his goals 
and convince them that it was their 
idea all along, and expects to be paid 
for his assistance. The original ob-
jective of the magi will need to be 
tailored for your troupe, but it is no 
coincidence that it will cause them 
to cross paths with Jabier’s enemies. 
He spreads rumors to attract the at-
tention of magi (these may be true 
or false), concerning something the 
magi desire or desperately need. 
Also, since they are being manipu-
lated by someone who is uninformed 
as to the ﬁner points of the Code of 
Hermes, there is the risk they may 
wind up violating their Oath by in-
terfering with mundanes. 
In the end, Jabier might double-
cross the magi, attempt a charming 
explanation, or convincingly lie and 
keep his secret. If Jabier and com-
pany continue in employment, the 
magi have gained an elite unit of pro-
fessional soldiers that are brave and 
loyal. However, their ﬁrst loyalty is 
to one another, and they continue to 
have their own secret intrigues and 
occasionally get the magi involved in 
their adventures.
THE STRANGE SOLDIERS
The covenant employs a compa-
ny of Almogavars that is an odd band 
of outcasts and outsiders. One is a 
Berber who deserted the Almohade 
army; their big bruiser is Jewish; and 
their stoic leader is secretly a wom-
an. One veteran soldier named Car-
los is stranger than the rest, for he 
unknowingly possesses The Gift. His 
fellows have known him many years, 
and don’t think he is any stranger 
than they are. They just think he is 
just socially awkward with new peo-
ple, and are amused by his difﬁculty 
with animals. But they recognize his 
ability to sense danger and perceive 
hidden threats, a trait for which they 
praise him, and attribute to wisdom 
and experience.
Carlos’ Gift grants the Super-
natural Virtue of Premonitions. He 
would make a ﬁne apprentice for an 
adventurous magus, but an adult ap-
prentice presents special challenges, 
and Carlos is stubborn and set in 
his ways. As a further complication, 
perhaps his Gift is ﬁrst discovered 
by a visiting magus. Carlos refuses 
to separate from his fellows, and the 
covenant risks violence against their 
guest or possibly losing their elite 
grogs to a rival covenant.

Grogs
of skill and discipline willing to work 
with magi. The culture and code of 
the Almogavars make them an excel-
lent ﬁt. Though usually employed as a 
group, they can also be hired individu-
ally as specialists. 
Character Creation
Almogavar characters must take 
the Social Status Virtue of Almoga-
var, and may select Virtues and Flaws 
as normal. Their regular outﬁt is as 
described, but players may equip 
their characters as they choose with 
Standard Armaments. The combi-
nation of sheepskin leather and the 
open-faced iron helmet grants a Pro-
tection of 1, with a Load of 1. They 
typically carry a short sword, and oc-
casionally a small round shield. The 
azcona is used as a short spear on foot 
or while mounted, or is thrown as a 
javelin. Use combat scores for how 
the weapon is being used.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Almogavars emphasizes courage, 
fortitude, and cleverness. Suggested 
Virtues include Enduring Constitution, 
Reserves of Strength, Tough, Warrior, 
an Afﬁnity with Single Weapon or 
Thrown Weapon, and Puissant Single 
Weapon or Thrown Weapon.
Several Personality Flaws can be 
used to reﬂect the life of an Almo-
gavar. Dutybound could represent 
their code of honor and discipline, 
Proud a sense of individual dignity, or 
what others see as Reckless could be 
the bravery that comes from having 
stared death in the face. As mercenar-
ies are often looked down upon, they 
might be Oversensitive to insults. 
Almogavars are also known for being 
Generous to the poor and Compas-
sionate for the oppressed. General 
Flaws can represent injuries from past 
battles, such as Disﬁgured, Missing 
Ear, Missing Eye, Missing Hand, and 
Lingering Injury.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
For Martial Abilities, Almogavars 
focus on Single Weapon and Thrown 
Weapon. Hunting and Survival are im-
portant, and their basic socialization 
revolves around Carouse, Folk Ken, 
and Leadership. 
They also acquire the Ability of 
Profession: Soldier, as do other merce-
naries and members of a paid military. 
As with other Profession Abilities, this 
is a catch-all for knowing for how to 
do one’s job. For a soldier, this includes 
things such as packing gear, pacing a 
march, making camp, and performing 
the duties of their ofﬁce. 
TRAINING PACKAGES
Suggested 
Childhood 
Train-
ing Packages include Athletic, Mis-
chievous, and Traveling Childhood. 
For Career Training Packages, sug-
gestions include Javeliner, Soldier, 
Woodsman, and the Non-Career 
Training Package of Forager. It is wise 
to round the character out with other 
useful Abilities as well.

Almogavar as Companion
You can also play an Almogavar 
as a companion. The character could 
be the Almogaten leading the unit, or 
perhaps he is a specialist of some sort. 
Optionally, he might hire himself out 
individually as a specialist. He will 
lack the support and camaraderie of a 
unit, but his fortunes are his own and 
he may be Poor or Wealthy.
As a companion, the character may 
have Story Flaws, and these could ap-
ply to himself or his whole unit. En-
emies is an obvious example. Close 
Family Ties could represent a tightly 
bonded unit, and maybe they are all re-
lated. Dependents may be unusual, but 
some bands of Almogavars include the 
women and children of the warriors in 
addition to the usual camp followers.

Grogs
Animal Trainer
I’d stay clear of Blackeye, sir. He don’t 
cower, he ﬁghts. You smell of strangeness to 
him, sir. He’d have your throat, he would.
General Background
Granted authority over his lord’s 
kennels because of his exceptional skill 
with animals, William the Houndsman 
holds a peculiar place among his mas-
ter’s servants: while the lord’s animals 
respond very well to him, all the folk 
treat him with deep suspicion and fear. 
His lord has recognized this sensation 
as similar to that he feels when meet-
ing with those strange magi of that 
tower on the edge of his lands. He has 
sent William to their tower to man-
age his kennels there, away from the 
poor regard of his other castle folk. 
Fortunately for William, the wizards 
mostly keep themselves to them-
selves, because they scare him and his 
dogs. Unfortunately for him however, 
they also seem to employ even more 
soldiers than his lord, none of whom 
seem to like him very much.
Animals and magi rarely mix well; 
The Gift prevents most contact. As 
well as forcing them to walk every-
where, this is problematic for any ma-
gus who would live among the lords of 
men; going out hunting is practically 
impossible if you can approach nei-
ther horse nor hound. But some magi 
employ grogs skilled speciﬁcally in 
training animals to their purpose, and 
for some such grogs, magi may be the 
only masters who would have them.
An Animal Trainer will most likely 
be specialized in dealing with hounds, 
hawks, or horses. For one who would 
ﬁnd employment at a covenant, his 
skill need not be quite so mundane: 
perhaps he has a particular talent for 
handling grifﬁns!
Besides the obvious attraction to a 
covenant for a young man who trains 
grifﬁns, mundane beasts are likely 
to be of interest as well. Many magi 
would desire to employ someone 
able to train horses to accept a Gifted 
rider, or a pack of war dogs to work 
with a Flambeau knight. However, 
this can take many years, by which 
time most beasts would be too old for 
any useful purpose.
As covered in Art & Academe, a 
trainer generates a number of train-
ing points in each season that she 
spends working with an animal (see 
the Formulae later). Once these train-
ing points equal the creature’s Might, 
the animal is trained and will follow its 
master’s commands. All training must 
be continuous and uninterrupted, for 
as many seasons as are required. Most 
mundane animals lack a Conﬁdence 
Score, so this will typically require a 
total (Intelligence + Animal Handling 
+ Animal Ken) of 2+ to train an ani-
mal within a single season. A more ex-
perienced trainer may tame additional 
animals in a season, potentially as 
many as her Animal Handling Ability.
TRAINING POINTS  
ACCUMULATED EACH SEASON:  
Intelligence + Animal Handling  
+ Animal Ken – Creature’s Might  
– Gift Penalty
REQUIRED NUMBER OF POINTS:  
Creature’s Might
MUNDANE ANIMAL MIGHT =  
1 + (2 x Conﬁdence Score)
Because of The Gift, a magus who 
seeks to train animals mundanely 


--- Page ---

94
Grogs
would need a much higher Animal 
Handling Ability (at least 3), which 
represents a signiﬁcant expense of ex-
perience points.
Note that an animal can be trained 
to accept speciﬁc individuals with The 
Gift, but not The Gift itself; a pega-
sus trained to accept one Gifted rider 
must be retrained to accept another.
The advantages to a covenant 
for employing an Animal Trainer are 
clear, but it is less obvious why an Ani-
mal Trainer would want to work for a 
covenant. Spending more time with 
animals than with people might make 
his departure from common society 
more tolerable, but there should be 
more compelling reasons for a grog to 
isolate himself in this way.
For instance, Animal Ken is a very 
popular Supernatural Virtue for an 
Animal Trainer character, but whereas 
this will likely incur suspicion from 
commoners, it could be valued highly 
in a covenant. Such grogs, placing 
themselves outside of normal society, 
should take an appropriate Person-
ality Flaw, or something relating to 
their background or nature, such as 
Bad Reputation.
Character Creation
The following suggestions cover 
the most important points to bear in 
mind when creating an Animal Trainer.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Obviously, every Animal Trainer 
character should have a good Animal 
Handling score. Animal Ken is the ex-
ception rather than the rule — how-
ever, since you will likely want to play 
an exceptional character, this is not 
unexpected in an Animal Trainer grog.
Other useful Abilities include Ride, 
for a horseman; Leadership, for a mas-
ter of kennels; Bargain, if the Animal 
Trainer is also involved in the buying 
and selling of beasts of burden; Sur-
vival, if he is spending his days up on 
the moors with his sheep; and Hunt, if 
he is a falconer. You should also select 
a Profession Ability related to his spe-
ciﬁc trade, such as Profession: Feuterer 
(master of hounds), and so forth. The 
obvious exception to this is if your Ani-
mal Trainer is entirely self-taught, such 
as the forest girl who talks with uni-
corns. Folk Ken should be considered 
for any grog dealing with other people, 
but many Animal Trainers lead quite a 
reclusive lifestyle. Craft Abilities can 
be useful in some situations: the far-
rier practices Craft Blacksmith (horse-
shoes), and the teamster probably has 
Craft Cartwright (repairing wheels).
TRAINING PACKAGES
Appropriate training packages are: 
Animal Trainer (obviously!), Farmer, 
Magician (if she deals with magical 
animals), Rider, Woodsman.
SAMPLE ANIMAL  
TRAINER CHARACTERS
These various characters represent 
Animal Trainers at different ages, of 
different social strata, and who work 
with different animals.
Madoc, Age 15 
Young Shepherd
Madoc despairs of his lonely exis-
tence up in the hills, but has cried wolf 
once too often and has been shunned 
by his village as a liar and a thief; the 
covenant offers comfort, security, and 
above all, other people. If only the far-
rier would believe him when he says 
he never set the best horse in the sta-
bles to bolt.

his old dogs about learning new tricks.

Animal Trainer  
as Companion
Any of the Animal Trainer char-
acters earlier could be created as an 
interesting companion simply by add-
ing a Story Flaw. One of Alyse’ gry-
phons could actually be a Magical 
Animal Companion, if it were consid-
ered a close friend rather than a ﬂying 
mount. Perhaps William’s hounds are 
all actually a single magical animal, as 
a gestalt manifestation? As a compan-
ion character, Madoc might be des-
perately honest in all dealings — but 
afﬂicted by Beelzebub, who seeks to 
corrupt his pious soul; he may have 
the Cursed Guile and Plagued by Su-
pernatural Entity Flaws.
Companion characters are gener-
ally expected to be signiﬁcantly more 
capable than grogs; in most cases, 
this is very simple to do, by purchas-
ing more of the required Abilities 
for their role — taking Leadership, 
Ride, and an extra weapon Ability or 
two covers the difference between 
a knight and a soldier. But there are 
really only one or two pertinent 
Abilities to choose from for an Ani-
mal Trainer, so your companion will 
likely be much more varied in her 
capabilities than your grog. If you’re 
after “the best trainer in the region,” 
then you will want Puissant Animal 
Handling, Afﬁnity with Animal Han-
dling, and very probably the Animal 
Ken Virtue.
A character may be an Animal 
Trainer out of necessity rather than in 
a professional capacity. A lady whose 
lover transforms into an owl every 
morning needs to train as a falconer 
simply to keep him with her through 
the day. Certain literary necessities 
demand that she be a shapeshifter as 
well; the owl and his lady both are 
companion characters, sharing the 
True Love and Lycanthrope Flaws.
Animal Trainer Story Seeds
As well as being a potentially 
valuable member of a turb, an Ani-
mal Trainer can be the catalyst for 
many interesting stories, especially if 
magical animals are involved.
THE EYES OF A HAWK
A maga is departing the covenant 
and sees a haggard young man gaz-
ing intently at a bird of prey circling 
overhead, which in turn is gazing 
intently at her. What does each see 
in the other that holds their atten-
tion so ﬁrmly? Jack Faulkner served 
an important knight in the region 
— until one of his kites suddenly 
attacked the knight’s daughter and 
blinded her. Accused of carelessness 
and assault, Jack was ﬂogged and 
dismissed from the knight’s service. 
Jack has wandered aimless and pen-
niless since; he has recently strayed 
near the covenant. The kite he has 
spotted is a strikingly beautiful spec-
imen of its species; it is a Hawk of 
Virtue, who recognizes the maga for 
her Gift. Did it have a reason to at-
tack the girl? Could she be a change-
ling? Or could the bird have a se-
cret, sinister purpose? Kites are well 
known as thieves and tricksters. In 
neither case could the proud knight 
admit Jack Faulkner back into his 
service, not after having punished 
him so publicly.
THE HORSE WHISPERER
Lydie is a young girl who talks to 
horses. She prefers their company to 
humans, because folk are rude and 
cruel to her — even her own family, 
who deem her wicked and corrupt. 
This drew the attention of a magus 
who then bought her from her par-
ents (they were only too glad to be 
rid of the witching child) to train as 
his apprentice. She has studied with 
him for three years now, but still re-
sists all attempts to be Opened to the 
Arts. In his arrogance, he refuses to 
believe that Lydie may not possess 
The Gift — all the signs are true. Ex-
cept, of course, that animals do not 
shun her as they do him. Unfortu-
nately, she has Animal Ken, but no 
touch of The Gift at all.
A WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING
The covenant keeps a ﬂock 
of sheep, for meat and cheese; its 
sheep share the hills with other vil-
lagers’ ﬂocks, and this has served 
everyone well enough for years. 
But something is wrong. The other 
shepherds are losing sheep to some 
night predator, while the covenant’s 
ﬂock is left untouched – and every-
one is blaming young Madoc. Of 
course, the boy is innocent, but no-
body believes him. The true culprit 
is one of his rams: a magical animal 
that turns into a wolf at night, and 
goes hunting. He does not kill and 
eat the sheep of his own ﬂock, be-
cause they are family.

Grogs
The Bodyguard 
Maidservant
Your wine, my lady.
Many important and vital jobs are 
done by insigniﬁcant mundanes, who 
go unnoticed before the eyes of magi, 
lords, and clergy alike. These unsung 
heroes rarely win a place in history. 
However, a conniving master can put 
this virtual invisibility to much use. 
This bland and demure maidservant 
can ﬁll many roles.
General Background
This female grog has never felt at 
home in the rigid roles of gender and 
feudal hierarchy of mundane society. 
From an early age, she has yearned for 
danger, adventure, and most of all inde-
pendence and freedom. But for a low-
born girl, all this is most often an im-
possible dream. Before she was mature 
enough for her family or village to seal 
her fate, and force her to marry and fol-
low a peasant’s life, she ﬂed. She spent 
some time actively seeking out people 
different enough, and places sufﬁcient-
ly strange, to offer her the needed break 
from society. And in the end, Mythic 
Europe offers only one real place like 
this — an Hermetic covenant.
Swallowing her pride for a time, 
she had to suffer manual work and the 
indignities of being a common wom-
an, but it was still a lot better than life 
in your average farming village. Even-
tually, she had found enough training 
and practiced enough for the magi to 
notice her special skills. To outside 
observers, she is still a mere maidser-
vant, assistant, scribe, or other insig-
niﬁcant minion. But she really serves 
as a bodyguard in disguise for a magus, 
as well as a set of invisible eyes and 
ears. Among the mundanes, a maga 
can beneﬁt greatly from being able 
to bring her protection into feminine 
circles, where male guards get left out-
side. A magus may ﬁnd he has access 
to these female circles, using his maid-
servant as intermediary.
Lacking the brawn and toughness 
of most shield grogs, she really doesn’t 
cut it for front line ﬁghts. Instead, she 
manages by being more clever, alert, 
and opportunistic than the rest, and 
by being inconspicuous to the very 
last instant. The secretive nature of 
her work means that some events blow 
her cover. This forces her to change 
position, apparent vocation, and ap-
pearance once in a while. But these 
challenges are what drives her, her 
skills developing in the independence 
granted her at the covenant.
Character Creation
Here are outlined suggestions, rec-
ommendations, and tips for creation 
of a Bodyguard Maidservant character.
Bodyguard Maidservant Story Seeds
The following story seeds could 
involve a Bodyguard Maidservant.
THE SWITCH
During an extended journey, the 
magi and retainers come across a 
merchant with a caravan of substan-
tial size, followed by the unavoid-
able pilgrims and beggars. Deciding 
to combine safety in numbers with 
a little comfort, the magi accept the 
invitation of the merchant. During 
the night, a young girl sneaks into 
the midst of the characters. She 
claims she is the daughter of a no-
bleman being held captive, but that 
she managed to sneak out for a short 
time. If they don’t wish to help her 
escape the merchant, she slips away, 
or is a very quiet captive. If helped, 
she reveals that she is really a ser-
vant who changed places with her 
mistress, so she could escape. 
But the mistress obviously failed 
to get safely away and obtain help, 
so now the servant is in trouble. 
As the mistress is the daughter of a 
robber baron, a rival to the caravan 
master, great rewards could be had. 
Meanwhile, the caravan master is go-
ing to pieces over losing his captive, 
because holding her as hostage was 
the only thing keeping local bandits 
from attacking, since they refer to 
the robber baron. Now the charac-
ters must keep the servant girl safe 
and unnoticed so she can help them 
ﬁnd the baron’s daughter, while at 
the same time being under attack by 
local bandits.
THE UNKNOWN ASSASSIN
A magus cannot for any reason 
call off a meeting he has with an 
important nobleman or clergyman, 
not even when he knows one of his 
rivals has hired a highly qualiﬁed as-
sassin. Nervous to the point of para-
noia, he and his female bodyguard – 
who is disguised as a scribe – attend 
the meetings. Meanwhile, special-
ists and discreet magi from his cov-
enant try to get to the bottom of the 
case. Who wants the magus dead? 
Who is the assassin, and how will 
he make the hit? The entire time, 
the magus and the bodyguard sit at 
the edges of their chairs, eyes dart-
ing around to each and every face or 
corner in the room, as discreetly as 
it can be done.

Grogs
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
The following Virtues may apply 
to a Bodyguard Maidservant charac-
ter: Keen Vision, Sharp Ears, Light-
ning Reﬂexes, Puissant Awareness, 
Puissant Guile, Forgettable Face*
If the concept calls for a body-
guard or assassin with larger weap-
onry than daggers, you need a Virtue 
to be allowed to purchase Martial 
Abilities. Warrior is a good choice; 
Custos might make you too high-pro-
ﬁle, which would defeat the purpose. 
Educated or Arcane Lore might ﬁt a 
mature or older character, to repre-
sent the fact that the magi allow her 
to become literate and learn Latin and 
various mystical abilities.
The Bodyguard Maidservant may 
suffer from some of these Flaws: Small 
Frame, Oversensitive (chauvinism), 
Mistaken Identity, Weak Personality*, 
Compulsive Lying*, Uninspirational*
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
SOCIAL STATUS
Covenfolk is recommended, and al-
though the single magus you work for 
might hold you in high regard, appoint-
ing you to Custos is detrimental to you 
staying incognito. The same goes for 
most other Social Status Virtues.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Appropriate Abilities are: Aware-
ness, Athletics, Guile, Legerdemain, 
Brawl, Profession (various)
TRAINING PACKAGES
Training packages include: Social, 
Exploring, or Mischievous Childhood. 
Courtier, Conman, Harlot, Tumbler, 
or Servant. Charmer or Covenfolk, 
combined depending on the concept.
SAMPLE ABILITY SCORES
YOUNG BODYGUARD (AGE 15): Ath-
letics 3 (dodging), Awareness 4 
(alertness), Brawl 3 (dagger), Folk 
Ken 2 (magi), Guile 3 (10) (iden-
tity change), Native Language 5 
(being subservient), Profession: 
Maidservant 3 (tidying up)
MATURE BODYGUARD (AGE 25): Athletics 
3 (dodging), Awareness 5 (alertness), 
Brawl 3 (dagger), Etiquette 2 (her-
metic), Folk Ken 3 (anticipating at-
tack), Guile 5 (20) (identity change), 
Legerdemain 3 (holdout), Native 
Language 5 (being subservient), Pro-
fession: Maidservant 3 (tidying up)
Concept Variations
With the skills required to go for 
long periods of time with a changed 
identity, in disguise and playing a 
part, this character could easily pull 
off other jobs than bodyguarding. 
She could serve well as an assassin, 
by focusing more on a Martial Abil-
ity, Stealth, and perhaps Profession: 
Poisoner, Herbalism, or Alchemy for 
concocting poison. Or she could serve 
as a spy or saboteur with little change, 
although being literate can be a huge 
boon. Visitors usually pay little heed 
to an anonymous servant, so a person 
with sharp ears can pick up many use-
ful things. She could even be sent to 
other covenants or castles, to spy or to 
gather arcane connections.
Bodyguard Maidservant 
as Companion
As a character in the companion 
slot, she has enough extra Virtues to 
become an expert in her ﬁeld. Using 
Puissance and Afﬁnities and perhaps 


--- Page ---

98
Grogs
Learn (Ability) From Mistakes or 
Careful with (Ability), a highly skilled 
bodyguard or spy can be created. Im-
proved or Great Characteristics may 
also stack the odds in her favor. Special 
skills can be added to the concept with 
a multitude of Supernatural Virtues or 
Abilities; Entrancement, Magic Sen-
sitivity, Premonitions, Second Sight, 
Piercing Gaze, Skinchanger, or Shape-
shifter are useful examples. An Edu-
cated character and one with Arcane 
Lore can be a great boon to the magi.
The role of such a companion can 
have a much larger scope than the grog. 
Being more than a simple servant, the 
maid most likely plays a larger part in 
decision-making and planning. The 
work and assignments can be more elab-
orate or long-term, and by adding a Sto-
ry Flaw the whole affair can be woven 
into stories, integrating with personal 
issues. The maid and the magus could 
take advantage of Enemies, Mistaken 
Identity, Blackmail, or Close Family Ties 
as openings for plots or missions.
As a companion, this character 
could also easily run missions with a 
staff and accomplices, providing seeds 
for using other companions and grogs 
in the story, which would again create 
stories for the entire troupe.
The Bull
I was only looking at it!
Some grogs stand out because they 
perform unusual functions. Others 
stand out because they are a classic 
stereotype. Among the ﬁghting grogs, 
the Bull is one such.
General Background
Every covenant turb has one. One 
guy, built like a brick outhouse, none 
too bright and probably a bit clumsy 
as well. But he has a heart of gold; he’s 
brave and loyal, and the best kind of 
comrade in arms anyone could imag-
ine. His comrades gladly share their 
food with him, as he would do the 
same for them. If they get hurt, he car-
ries them on his back to safety.
Playful teasing is the order of the 
day; he takes it all in his stride, and 
tries to give back, but lacks sophisti-
cation. His role is, to some degree, to 
provide comic relief, but he is not a 
caricatured clown — more of a morale 
booster. Most days he is laughed with 
more than he is laughed at. Of course, 
a few bad apples, be they too clever or 
cruel, always spoil things by overdoing 
it, and that can really set him boiling.
The role in the turb is closely re-
lated to the Tough Guy. He doesn’t 
have the potential to be a trusted Cus-
tos or personal shield grog of the magi, 
nor will he ever be a good leader of a 
trained group. But he is a good man for 
a vanguard or covering the ﬂank during 
battle. He is deﬁnitely handy when the 
turb is in a tight spot, and they’ll be glad 
they brought him along as backup. For 
the more delicate matters, he is best left 
home. Many social operations could 
suffer greatly from his “helpful” contri-
butions. But if they need heavy lifting 
or serious bruising? He’s the man.
Character Creation
Use the following notes for creat-
ing a Bull character.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
The Bull has his problems, but 
he may enjoy some of these Virtues: 
Large, Tough, Rapid Convalescence, 
Reserves of Strength, Enduring Con-
stitution, Warrior, Turb Trained*
The following Flaws may prove 
applicable to a Bull character: Clum-
sy, Carefree, Covenant Upbringing, 
Gullible*, Uncontrollable Strength*, 
Offensive Fighter*, Magical Fascina-
tion*, Pack Mentality, (Realm) Stig-
mata, Master of None, various Social 
Status Flaws (see later)
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
SOCIAL STATUS
Covenfolk or Turb Trained seem 
appropriate, although Wanderer or 
Branded Criminal could do. Outcast or 
Outlaw could be an answer to why he 
has joined the covenant. He is unlikely 
to be in a position of authority, so Cus-
tos, Mercenary Captain, Outlaw Lead-
er, or Knight are inappropriate choices.
Note that unless the Social Sta-
tus chosen allows you to take Martial 
Abilities, you must take a Virtue for 
this (e.g., Warrior).
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Abilities include: Brawl, Single 
Weapon, Great Weapon, Athletics
SUGGESTED TRAINING PACKAGES
Training packages include: Athletic, 
Covenant-bred, or Exploring Child-
hood. Footpad, Laborer, Sentry, or Sol-

Concept Variations
A concept related to the Bull is the 
bulwark. The bulwark is a much more 
defensive ﬁghter, more focused on hold-
ing the line than breaking it. This grog 
could serve as a defensive vanguard, or 
might even be a shield grog for a ma-
gus. This is done by avoiding any Flaws 
which make him prone to aggression, 
impulsiveness, or distraction from duty; 
he should deﬁnitely not take the Berserk 
Virtue. Consider adding Dutybound or 
Vow, concerning the protection of his 
master. Long Winded or Lightning Re-
ﬂexes might be valued Virtues. For com-
Bull Story Seeds
The Bull is particularly prone to 
blundering into stories.
SUCH BAD LUCK  
ALMOST SEEMS UNNATURAL
During a Tribunal, the Bull is un-
wittingly entrusted with a delicate 
and valuable object owned by a ma-
gus from another covenant. Natural-
ly, it ends up damaged, which stirs 
up a lot of commotion. The offend-
ed magus not only demands restitu-
tion, but also severe punishment of 
the grog, and holds one of the magi 
responsible. 
The speed with which this case 
starts to build does seem suspicious 
to the magi. Someone knowledge-
able in the Order’s affairs and recent 
history remembers a similar situa-
tion some years back, which also 
centered on the offended magus. 
Another clever companion starts to 
ﬁnd scraps of evidence proving this, 
because naturally the whole thing is 
fabricated. But at the same time, the 
Bull is in trouble in more than one 
way. While most of his turb mates 
support his claim of bad luck, a few 
hold it personally against him. 
Furthermore, the grog leader of 
the visiting magi demands satisfac-
tion by combat, and his turb stoop 
to all-time lows concerning cheat-
ing and sabotage. Scufﬂes are bound 
to occur, but the duel ought to be 
stopped. Can the clever magi or 
their retinue solve the affair and stop 
it? The offended magus becomes an-
gry and reckless once his plot starts 
to fall apart. He might resort to cer-
tamen right there, and in the end 
might also challenge the opposition 
to Wizard’s War if he is humiliated or 
pushed sufﬁciently.
THE NEW RECRUIT
A magus who recently joined the 
covenant brought along some of his 
own servants, among them the Bull. 
A few of the other magi along with 
their retinue currently have him 
out on a mission to a highly magi-
cal forest, which is part diplomatic 
outreach to the magical spirits of 
the place, and part vis hunt. At ﬁrst, 
he seemed ﬁne, a solid ﬁghter, and 
quickly became popular among the 
turb, bringing laughter to the ranks. 
But just minutes into the delicate 
situation with the magical beings 
of the forest, temptation sets in 
everywhere he looks. He is bound 
to get too nosy at some point. The 
rest of the turb try to keep him from 
getting in trouble, but it becomes 
more difﬁcult at every new encoun-
ter. Potential conﬂicts arise, which 
must be dealt with. Touchy-feely 
diplomacy seems to have gone out 
the window, however, and kicking 
the encounter up a notch is more 
to the liking of at least one of the 
magi. And power seems to be a lan-
guage understood by the spirits. 
The next obstacles come once the 
Bull starts pilfering things to take 
home as souvenirs …
WHIPPING INTO SHAPE
A young man who until recent-
ly worked as a laborer at the cov-
enant has been promoted to ﬁght-
ing grog. He has been in training 
for a short time, and shows great 
potential, or at least great strength 
and toughness. The grog leaders 
decide to bring him along on a mis-
sion to whip him into shape, since 
a routine matter of checking up on 
some loose threads from a previous 
event in a nearby village needs see-
ing to. But the grog not only lacks 
the discipline of most other grogs, 
he also has a knack of getting into, 
not trouble as such, but interesting 
situations. What could possibly go 
wrong here? 
Perhaps he is socially inept and 
offends someone the leaders need to 
talk to. Perhaps he derails the trip by 
practically tripping over something 
magical. In the end, the trip encoun-
ters obstacles of a manageable kind 
— providing much-needed lessons 
for the grog — as well as some to-
tally unexpected windfall, like a vis 
ﬁnd. Or possibly it yields the open-
ing for another story, like discover-
ing an infernalist circle, or a contest-
ed vis source.

bat abilities, replace Great Weapon with 
Single Weapon, and a shield is almost a 
must, as is heavy armor.
Keeping the idea of the Bull, an 
alternative idea is to tone down the 
martial concept and relate his mental-
ity and style to a manual laborer. Being 
a fully trained craftsman probably isn’t 
on the Bull’s cards, but there’s hard 
work that needs doing at every cov-
enant. He could be the hulking porter 
or beefy well-digger making a fool of 
himself, or the person everyone teases 
playfully. But in the end he is a true 
buddy, loyal to his mates.
The Bull as Companion
When using this concept as a com-
panion, do not change it radically. The 
intent is a slightly comical grog, well-
liked and possessing high spirits, a per-
son whom others lovingly tease in good 
fun, and who is unfortunate or unlucky 
in some areas. With a larger Virtue bud-
get, he could be made into a very ef-
ﬁcient ﬁghter, and by using many of the 
suggested Flaws, he could keep this con-
cept. But he is not a leader, and should 
not aspire to become one, nor should 
one invest in Social Status virtues giving 
him men of his own. Instead, view him 
as a proﬁcient individual, and focus on 
making him tough, resilient, and able to 
recover from the injuries he will inevi-
tably suffer. You could in fact give him 
all the suggested Virtues, perhaps swap-
ping Large for Giant Blood. 
Working further with the supernat-
ural aspects, a character with good syn-
ergy — story-wise — with the Magical 
Fascination concept could be created 
by adding Faerie Friend, Plagued by 
Supernatural Entity, or something simi-
lar. Using Arcane Lore, he could actual-
ly be proﬁcient in Magic or Faerie Lore, 
upping the stakes for his involvement 
in these sorts of stories.
The Confessor
This is not the ﬁrst time we have discussed 
these matters, maga Umbra, and I fear it shall 
not be the last.
A magus’ soul is imperiled just 
as much, if not more so, by tempta-
tion and obsession as any person’s. 
The abstract allure of knowledge and 
power provide new opportunities for 
sin to take hold and guide the magus 
away from the righteous path. So it 
is important for the magus to make 
peace with his maker and be absolved 
of sin. This is where the Confessor 
comes in.
General Background
Every community has a need to 
ﬁnd resolution for things that prey 
heavily upon the conscience. Chris-
tian tradition has the sacrament of 
penance and the practice of confes-
sion at its heart. In confessing his sins 
to a priest and undertaking the pre-
scribed penance, a character’s soul is 
cleansed, and the character is free to 
resume his life unencumbered by sin. 
This is one of the key roles played by

Grogs
the priest in his community.
Covenants are often similar to 
manorial holdings in that they rely 
on one or more villages not only for 
income, but also for their day-to-day 
activities. The covenant is also home 
to servants, cooks, guards, librarians, 
and all manner of other covenfolk. 
These communities, both inside and 
outside of the covenant, need spiri-
tual guidance.
The Confessor is a priest or reli-
gious leader who provides conﬁdential 
counsel and moral guidance to those 
in his parish. In the case of a Christian 
priest, the receiving of confession is a 
responsibility of his ofﬁce and a duty 
to his parishioner’s soul. Even if the 
Confessor doesn’t live within the cov-
enant, he lives nearby and receives the 
visits of magi, just as he would others 
in his parish.
The Confessor is also well-placed 
to act on behalf of the magi in matters 
concerning the Church, and may ﬁnd 
himself drafted into service from time 
to time.
Character Creation
The following notes will help with 
the creation of a Confessor.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
The Confessor may be anyone 
from an inexperienced young priest, 
through a mature monk, to an elder-
ly imam. But he tends to have high 
Intelligence, Communication, and 
Presence characteristics. There is an 
opportunity to build long relation-
ships between a younger Confes-
sor and the magi of the covenant, 
and see those relationships grow 
throughout the saga. The character 
can be used by the storyguide to 
confront characters with their ac-
tions, and help the players explore 
their consequences.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
The following lists of Virtues and 
Flaws are appropriate for various reli-
gious leaders who might be cast in the 
role of Confessor.
CHRISTIAN CONFESSOR: Priest; Relic, 
Clear Thinker; Uncertain Faith*, 
Vow 
(Celibacy), 
Weakness 
(Drinking)
ISLAMIC CONFESSOR: ‘Alim**; Edu-
cated (Islamic), Clear Thinker;

Temperate
JEWISH CONFESSOR: Rabbi**; Educated 
(Hebrew)**, Clear Thinker; Out-
sider (Minor)**, Uncertain Faith*, 
Meddler (Minor)
* See Chapter 6: New Virtues and Flaws
** See Realms of Power: The Divine Revised 
Edition
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Aside from knowledge of Latin, 
the Artes Liberales, the Church, and 
Theology, the Confessor relies upon 
The Practice of Confession
In the Christian tradition, as de-
scribed in Realms of Power: The Divine 
Revised Edition, page 75, the suppli-
cant confesses his sins to a priest, is 
absolved of those sins, and receives 
a penance to perform. The priest 
sets the penance as beﬁts the sin. 
The character gains a temporary 
Conﬁdence point that can be used 
to help him complete his penance, 
and until the penance is completed, 
there exists a holy connection be-
tween the character and his con-
fessor. Every Christian character is 
expected to confess her sins at least 
once every year. See the Diocese 
chapter in the The Church supple-
ment for more detail.
As with Christianity, confession 
of one’s sins is integral to both Juda-
ism and Islam. But unlike Christian-
ity, confession is made directly to 
God, with no human intermediary. 
Those who have sinned are urged 
to pray and undertake penance. 
The two traditions also differ from 
Christianity and from each other, in 
other ways.
The ﬁrst ten days of the Jewish 
month of Tishri are spent seeking 
reconciliation with those whom 
Jews may have wronged. This is 
in preparation for the tenth day of 
Tishri, known as Yom Kippur, or 
the Day of Atonement. This day is 
set aside to atone for the sins of the 
previous year. Jews must fast on this 
day, taking no food or drink; refrain 
from working; and engage in prayer 
and other cleansing rituals.
Followers of Islam may serve 
their penance by fasting for a peri-
od, but the act of seeking forgive-
ness from God or protection from 
sin is called Istighfar. This is found-
ed on the idea that God alone 
knows the deeds and thoughts of 
the supplicant. Istighfar is always 
partnered with Tauba, or repen-
tance, and no prayer for forgive-
ness or protection can be heartfelt 
without true repentance.
SECULAR CONFESSION
The Confessor, as presented 
here, is a religious ﬁgure who steers 
the character away from a path of 
sin. But as neither Islam nor Juda-
ism provide for anyone to intercede 
between the individual and their 
God, the Confessor role is instead a 
secular conﬁdante or trusted advisor. 
The nature of the relationship may 
mean that a religious ﬁgure is still 
appropriate, but with no implied 
doctrine present.

his Folk Ken for gaining an intuition 
of what troubles his ﬂock, Leadership 
to maintain his position as a pillar of 
the community, and various Lores for 
his village, the covenant, and the lo-
cal area to keep abreast of all the cur-
rent events.
TRAINING PACKAGES
The following training pack-
ages help to describe a typical Chris-
tian priest: Student (parish school), 
Churchman; Covenfolk, Local, Lead-
er, Public Ofﬁcial.
The Student training package 
is required to give the Confessor 
knowledge of Latin, key to his other 
Academic Abilities, but is gener-
ally not used more than once. The 
Covenfolk, Local, and Leader pack-
ages provide knowledge of and a 
connection to the Confessor’s parish. 
The Churchman package is the core 
package and should be taken at least 
once out of every three packages tak-
en for this character.
SAMPLE ABILITY SCORES
The following Ability scores have 
been generated based on the sug-
gested training packages earlier af-
ter taking a Mischievous Childhood 
package to describe the Confessor’s 
ill-spent younger years. The Abilities 
are appropriate for a Christian priest 
in the role of Confessor, but Islamic or 
Jewish characters will have a different 
focus, in addition to the extra 50 expe-
rience points they receive from their 
Educated Virtues.
Confessor Story Seeds
The following story seeds start 
with the Confessor and his relation-
ship to the magi and their covenant 
but provide challenges that the magi 
must face and resolve.
STRANGE PENANCE
An elderly Tytalus staying at the 
covenant suddenly falls into Twi-
light. Although he recovers, he has 
seen that his end is near, and calls 
for a confessor to hear his many 
and numerous sins. Uncertain 
what penance to give so old and so 
powerful a man, the inexperienced 
Confessor seeks the advice of the 
magi of the covenant, careful not to 
divulge the nature (or quantity) of 
the old man’s sins.
A SOURCE OF GOSSIP
The new Confessor hears the 
confessions of the covenfolk, includ-
ing the magi, in an antechamber off 
the main hall. But what’s discussed 
soon turns to gossip. Who or what 
has been eavesdropping on these pri-
vate moments, and what have they 
learned that the princeps doesn’t 
want revealed?
FALSE CONFESSION
The covenant is involved in a 
conﬂict that leads to a death. Soon 
after, the Confessor receives a visit 
from the maga involved, looking for 
absolution. The Confessor hears her 
confession and instructs her to un-
dertake a pilgrimage in penance for 
her sin. But it soon becomes apparent 
that the maga is making no prepara-
tions to leave. On challenging her, 
the maga denies any knowledge of 
the confession or the resulting pen-
ance. Has something affected her 
mind? Was it really her who sought 
confession? If not, what manner of 
creature could breach the Aegis? And 
perhaps more importantly, now that 
the Confessor has approached the 
maga, will she now confess her sin 
and see her soul cleansed of its taint?
BROKEN CONFIDENCES
The Confessor, after a lifetime 
of hearing the sins, squabbles, and 
sorrows of his parish, is abducted 
by demons, or faeries in the role of 
demons, each one intent on taking a 
sin from the Confessor’s memory and 
seeing it played out a thousandfold. 
As the beasts sweep across the land, 
they take the Confessor with them 
to feed their plague of evil. Villages 
and towns descend into anarchy un-
der the inﬂuence of the demons in-
spired by the Confessor. As the magi 
follow their friend and conﬁdante, 
they come face-to-face with their 
own sins, and must now explain their 
actions, once thought forgiven.
THE MANUAL OF CONFESSION
A popular and inﬂuential magus, 
rumored to wield holy magic, comes 
to the covenant looking for mate-
rial to help him with a tractatus he is 
writing. The book is a penitentiary, 
or a manual of confession, designed 
to help penitent and confessor alike 
to correctly identify their sins and 
the appropriate penance to be un-
dertaken. While mundane manuals 
of confession derive penances for an 
individual based on the four humors, 
the seven sins, and the seven virtues, 
the magus is attempting to add the 
ﬁfteen Hermetic Arts. Are the magi 
happy to have this magus poking 
around their sins, penances, and 
studies? What happens if his notes 
fall into the wrong hands? Come 
to that, as the magus visited a rival 
covenant the previous season, how 
can the magi get a look at his notes 
themselves?

PERSONALITY TRAITS
If the Confessor has taken the new 
Uncertain Faith Flaw, he has a Person-
ality Trait of the same name with a 
score of at least 1. As for other traits, 
he is likely to be a Good Listener, 
which helps further deﬁne his role in 
the saga. A third trait says more about 
the Confessor as a person, who may be 
Compassionate, Duty-Bound, or Strict.
The  
Corpse-Thief
Yes, my lord, guaranteed fresh. It was pro-
cured from the bishop only this morning...
A despicable character hated and 
feared by good Christian folk, the 
Corpse-Thief lurks around graveyards 
and gallows, seeking to steal ingredi-
ents to sell to witches and warlocks 
alike. He knows that the bodies of sui-
cides, murderers, and unbaptized chil-
dren fetch the highest prices among 
his clientele. Naturally, a Corpse-Thief 
plies a highly specialized trade, and 
both his customers and his raw mate-
rial are usually spread far and wide, oc-
casioning him to travel extensively.
A Corpse-Thief is likely to pick 
up a good knowledge of occult mat-
ters. Having the Penetration Ability 
gives him a working knowledge of 
arcane connections and sympathetic 
connections. Magic Lore or Infernal 
Lore, or more rarely Faerie or Divine 
Lore, tell him to what use each type 
of material can be put, and cover mat-
ters such as Shape and Material bo-
nuses and Enrichment of Objects of 
Virtue (see Realms of Power: Magic, page 
124). A Corpse-Thief with the appro-
priate (Realm) Lore also understands 
New Arcane Ability: Craft Poppets
The character can make efﬁgies 
of individuals out of wax, straw, 
and cloth that house an arcane con-
nection and simultaneously act as 
a sympathetic connection to the 
people they represents. A simple 
efﬁgy is good for one use, takes an 
hour to make, and requires a Dex-
terity + Craft Poppets roll against 
an Ease Factor of 9. A permanent 
poppet takes a week to make, and 
has an Ease Factor of 12. Permanent 
poppets can accept a new Arcane 
Connection once the previous one 
has expired; naturally, this must be 
to the same person. Unlike other 
symbolic representations, a poppet 
made with this Ability may be used 
by any person, not just the character 
who made it. Specialties: a particu-
lar type of target — women, magi, 
dragons, kings, etc. 
Preserving Arcane Connections
As detailed on page 64 of Art & Ac-
ademe, an apothecary can extend the 
lifespan of an Arcane Connection by 
preserving the material correctly. This 
can only be done for Arcane Connec-
tions of human, animal, or vegetable 
origin, and cannot be repeated to 
extend the duration further. Make a

what vis is, for what uses it might be 
employed, and where it tends to be 
found. Should the character also have 
Magic Sensitivity, he can locate vis 
himself, even if he cannot use it.
In addition to collecting body 
parts of the dead, a Corpse-Thief 
usually also specializes in taking ar-
cane connections from the living. A 
Corpse-Thief might steal to order, or 
else obtain material from prominent 
townsfolk, then offer them to the 
highest bidder among his usual con-
tacts. Combining the skills of a bur-
glar with his occult lore, he can creep 
into a house or workspace, and knows 
which objects and body exuviae tend 
to form the best arcane connections. 
Furthermore, he recognizes the im-
portance of handwritten documents, 
names, and personal data, such as 
birth dates, to the exercise of magic.
Typically, he crafts an efﬁgy of 
his victim called a “poppet” or “witch 
doll,” which takes advantage of sym-
pathetic bonuses. Embedded in the 
poppet is an arcane connection, and 
it is sold along with the name of the 
victim, an example of his handwrit-
ing, and possibly (if the Corpse-Thief 
is educated) a horoscope, all of which 
increase the efﬁcacy of the poppet 
to his client (ArM5, page 84). If the 
character has the professional skills 
of an apothecary, he can even extend 
the life of the arcane connection; this 
is useful if he cannot ﬁnd a seller im-
mediately (see insert).
A Corpse-Thief may even be 
skilled in petty magical practices him-
self. He may have inherited some mi-
nor magical item, or have an intrinsic 
magical power from a Supernatural 
Ability. Due to the personality of a 
typical Corpse-Thief, such abilities 
are often malicious in nature, or at 
least used maliciously. For example, 
the thief’s demon Valefar (Realms of 
Power: The Infernal, page 57) can teach a 
person how to make a Hand of Glory 
from the hand of a hanged murderer.
General Background
It takes a special sort of person to 
be a Corpse-Thief. Even the most in-
veterate, hard-bitten criminal gener-
ally shows respect for the dead. Fur-
thermore, the knowledge of forbidden 
things hints at a dark past. A Corpse-
Thief could have been the child of a 
witch or warlock, but showed no tal-
ent for sorcery at an early age, and so 
was put to work in a useful trade to 
support his parent. Alternatively, the 
Corpse-Thief could have been an ini-
tiate of a diabolic cult, who practiced 
his trade at the bidding of his infer-
nally tainted masters. The indoctrina-
tion that accompanies either of these 
backgrounds sets a twisted sense of 
morality that allows the character to 
do the horrible things that he does.
THE VIATICARUS
Another path to such a question-
able career is rooted in a superstition 
of the age: occasionally a person is 
given the Last Rites because he is 
near death, but then recovers. This is 
an exceptionally rare occurrence; in-
deed, the sacrament of Extreme Unc-
tion is supposed to guarantee death. 
Nevertheless, in Mythic Europe there 
are forces that can bring people back 
from the brink of death, not least of 
which is Hermetic magic. Far from be-
ing considered a second chance at life, 
such a circumstance is considered to 
generate a living corpse: neither truly 
alive nor properly dead. The viaticarus 
(“one prepared for the journey”) is le-
gally separated from society, and theo-
logically separated from the Church. 
He is denied further sacraments; this 
is the point behind the Last Rites. He 
cannot attend church, get married, or 
enter Holy Orders. 
Most signiﬁcantly, he cannot per-
form penance for any sins he commits 
henceforth. 
Common 
superstition 
holds that nothing he does now can 
affect the placement of his soul in the 
afterlife, and he is free to sin with-
out consequence. Church doctrine 
says otherwise, and suggests that the 
viaticarus should keep himself obses-
sively free from sin since it cannot be 
expiated. Legally, the bonds of mar-
riage are dissolved, and the “widow” is 
free to marry again. Viaticari may not 
write wills, since dead men technically 
do not own property. By many local

traditions they cannot eat meat, have 
sexual intercourse, or walk in bare feet.
It is perhaps no surprise if one of 
these “living corpses” takes on a mor-
ally repugnant role, if they consider 
themselves beyond morality and im-
mune to the burden of sin. As literal 
outcasts from society, they struggle to 
ﬁnd a means by which to earn a living, 
making them easy prey for unscrupu-
lous warlocks and magi. Unlike some 
grogs, a viaticarus might willingly 
work for Gifted individuals without 
reservation, eager for any acceptance, 
even if it is for what they do rather 
than for who they are.
Character Creation
Players may use the following 
notes in the creation of corpse-thieves. 
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
A Corpse-Thief probably lurks on 
the fringes of society, so Social Status 
Virtues such as Wise One or Wanderer 
are appropriate, as is the Outcast Social 
Status Flaw. Essential to this character 
is an understanding of esoteric lore, 
and he needs a Virtue which grants 
the capacity to take Arcane Abilities 
at character creation, such as Arcane 
Lore. Magic Sensitivity proves very 
useful to a character such as this, and 
Social Contacts allows him to have 
a wide client base among the hedge 
witches of the region. He also beneﬁts 
from Virtues that permit him to gain 
his raw ingredients more easily, such as 
Puissant Stealth and Light Touch. He 
may have the Minor Enchantments* 
Virtue to represent some of the magic 
he has acquired from his clients.
The Tainted with Evil Flaw is highly 
appropriate, as is the Viaticarus Flaw*. 
Thanks to his usual working hours, the 
Nocturnal Personality Flaw is suitable.
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
A Corpse-Thief needs the same 
Abilities that a regular thief beneﬁts

Corpse-Thief Story Seeds
The following suggestions give 
some ideas for stories involving 
Corpse-Thieves.
THE CAT’S-PAW
A player maga involved in a 
feud with a non-Hermetic wizard 
becomes the target of the Corpse-
Thief’s attention when he is com-
missioned to make a poppet of the 
player character. Having studied 
his target for a while, he decides to 
inﬁltrate the covenant as a day la-
borer or new servant, but through 
diligence or sheer good luck, he is 
caught in the act of retrieving his ar-
cane connection. The temptation to 
kill the Corpse-Thief immediately is 
likely to be great, but more could be 
learned if he is captured and ques-
tioned. With the right incentive, the 
Corpse-Thief will sell out his em-
ployer, and perhaps be able to sup-
ply a poppet of her that he made as 
insurance.
This story works equally well 
with a magus opponent who has de-
clared, or is about to declare, Wiz-
ard’s War against a player magus.
POACHER TURNED GAMEKEEPER
A Corpse-Thief who works for 
the covenant has a good profes-
sional knowledge of the local hedge 
wizards, and perhaps knows some 
of them personally. He may even be 
aware of their powers and weakness-
es. When the magi hear of a particu-
larly troublesome non-Hermetic 
wizard, they come to the Corpse-
Thief for information. He can give 
them a list of names who it might 
be, and where they each can be 
found. The magi may be surprised 
— dismayed, even! — by how many 
minor magical practitioners live in 
the region right under their noses. 
Why are there so many, what are 
they up to, and how did they remain 
unnoticed for so long?

Corpse-Thief  
as Companion
Were the Corpse-Thief to be 
conceived as a companion character, 
the most obvious change to make to 
this character is to give him some 
overt Supernatural Abilities of his 
own. Particularly appropriate are En-
trancement (ArM5, page 65), Curs-
ing (Hedge Magic Revised Edition, page 
35) or Hex (Realms of Power: The In-
fernal, page 92). Combined with his 
ability to generate high Penetration 
totals from efﬁgies and stolen arcane 
connections, these Abilities can even 
be useful against a magical opponent. 
The Diabolic Past Story Flaw is ide-
ally suited for a Corpse-Thief com-
panion character, as is the Enemy 
Story Flaw, representing former vic-
tims of his craft.
A grog character can be converted 
into a companion character through 
Initiation into a Folk Witch coven 
(Hedge Magic Revised Edition, page 33) or 
an infernal tradition (Realms of Power: 
The Infernal, page 126).
The Craftsman
Imagine the wonders that I could create in 
this place!
General Background
From the opulent coronation 
robes of a king to the simple milking 
stool used by the farmer’s daughter, 
everything in Mythic Europe passes 
through the hands of a craftsman. 
They are the lifeblood of trade and 
commerce, but all too often they are 
of low status, forced to eke out a liv-
ing by crafting the same items day 
after day, while others proﬁt from 
their work.
Life in a covenant offers great op-
portunity. Covenants are often rela-
tively wealthy, which is shared by all 
the covenfolk by way of a higher stan-
dard of living. Covenants also have ac-
cess to strange and unusual materials, 
which provide challenges and interest 
to eager craftsmen. And the presence 
of magi means that craftsmen are able 
to work on items and devices with 
qualities far beyond those found in the 
mundane world.
More than perhaps any other 
grog, the role of the Craftsman is one 
that can evolve through the life of a 
saga. Assuming that the Craftsman 
isn’t noteworthy enough to be given 
a longevity ritual, you can expect the 
son to take over from the father, or 
indeed the daughter from the moth-
er, during the course of a saga. This 
may happen more than once over the 
period of a particularly long or fast-
moving saga.
Craftsmen may be particularly im-
portant in covenants home to one or 
more Verditius magi. They have an 
immediate use as forge-companions, 
providing assistance in the labora-
tory that translates into more efﬁcient 
work, providing a bonus to Lab To-
tals. And a range of skilled craftsmen 
can provide training to the generalist 
Verditius keen to explore more than 
one craft.
Character Creation
The following notes will help with 
the creation of a Craftsman.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
More than other types of grog, 
there’s a reason to advance the Crafts-
man from his young apprenticeship 
years through to being a master crafts-
man in his own right, with apprentices 
of his own. The growth of the Crafts-
man mirrors the growth of the magi 
and the covenant, and the handing of 
the workshop from the master to the 
younger journeyman marks the pas-
sage of time in the saga. An apprentice 
should start around age 15 and prog-
ress to journeyman by age 30. In an-
other 15 years, he is likely to be a mas-
ter craftsman at the top of his game, 
and will hang up his tools by the age 
of 60.
Characteristics should suit his 
craft, so Strength for a blacksmith, 
and Dexterity for most other crafts. 
Craftsmen should have a bias toward 
the physical characteristics.

SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
A covenant blacksmith is likely 
to have a different set of Virtues and 
Flaws at the beginning of his career to 
those at the end.
APPRENTICE VIRTUES AND FLAWS: Guild 
Apprentice**; 
Improved 
Char-
acteristics, Puissant Blacksmith; 
Independent Craftsman**, Neces-
sary Magic Aura for Craft: Black-
smith*, Animal Companion
At some point in his career, he 
establishes himself as a craftsman in 
his own right. Given that the char-
acter may take only one Social Status 
Virtue, he may become a Craftsman, 
Journeyman**, or Custos. Taking 
Custos represents his increased sta-
tus and connection with the magi, 
and represents the opportunity for 
additional training and practice in Fi-
nesse, the control of enchanted tools 
and devices, and in Latin. Once the 
character enters open play, however, 
the covenant may train him in what-
ever they see ﬁt, regardless of his Vir-
tues or Flaws.
JOURNEYMAN VIRTUES 
AND FLAWS: 
Custos; Improved Characteristics, 
Puissant Blacksmith; Independent 
Craftsman**, Necessary Magic 
Aura for Craft: Blacksmith**, Ani-
mal Companion
The life of a Craftsman can often 
be a grind, either conﬁned to a work-
shop all day, or out on the road travel-
ing between jobs. So an Animal Com-
panion, as per the Flaw, is common. 
It might be the butcher’s dog, the 
seamstress’ cat, or even a succession of 
pet rats that have made the thatcher’s 
wagon their home.
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
** See City & Guild, page 53
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
A Craftsman learns his trade from 
his years as an apprentice through 
to his position and rank as a master. 
Those in the outside world, especially 
those who live in towns and cities, 
may ﬁnd themselves becoming more 
involved with the respective guilds 
for their profession or craft, but those 
who live and work in a covenant are 
less likely to develop in this way. They 
are more likely to be one of a handful 
of craftsmen looking after the needs 
of the covenant, their fortunes tied to 
those of their masters.
One skill that a covenant-trained 
Craftsman may develop that oth-
ers won’t is Finesse. While an Arcane 
Ability, Finesse governs the use and 
control of enchanted items. These are 
speciﬁcally useful for Rego Craft Mag-
ic (Covenants, page 49).
TRAINING PACKAGES
The following packages support 
a covenant-based Craftsman: Coven-
folk, Craftsman, Local, Trader, Trainer
It is also likely that the Craftsman 
will pick up some knowledge of super-
natural creatures, such as faeries curi-
ous about his work. Experience points 
from the earlier packages can be used 
to improve (Realm) Lore Abilities.
SAMPLE ABILITY SCORES
The sample Abilities listed later 
include Finesse. Any character can 
learn Finesse in the normal run of 
play if he is given the chance. Char-
acters may gain Finesse at character 
creation if they have an appropriate 
Virtue granting access to the Ability, 
such as Custos.

THE WORKSHOP
A Craftsman without a workshop 
cannot conduct his business. It is as-
sumed that all Craftsmen have a basic 
workshop equipped with tools and sup-
plied with materials sufﬁcient to sup-
port his trade. What actually deﬁnes 
the workshop varies according to the 
craft. For instance, a blacksmith needs 
a forge to contain the intense heat he 
works with, a tinker needs a handcart 
on which to carry his simple tools and 
wares, while a thatcher has little more 


--- Page ---

108
Grogs
than his tools and a wagon on which 
to carry his raw materials. The City & 
Guild supplement provides additional 
rules for representing and advancing 
workshops (page 65 onwards).
Each 
workshop 
is 
described 
through two characteristics, Innova-
tion and Raw Materials, and by in-
creasing these characteristics the the 
Craftsman can produce work of a 
higher quality. Workshop character-
istics are improved through spending 
excess Labor Points (City & Guild, page 
38) accumulated by the Craftsman.
Any advances in Innovation are re-
tained by the workshop, able to pass to 
the next generation, but improved Raw 
Materials have an additional yearly La-
bor Point cost that the Craftsman must 
pay to maintain them, and the beneﬁt 
is not passed on to the next generation. 
Increasing the Raw Materials charac-
teristic decreases the number of excess 
Labor Points the Craftsman has avail-
able for other advancements.
As a rule of thumb, if you don’t 
want to track grog Labor Points, you 
can assume the following workshop 
statistics:
STANDARD WORKSHOP: Innovation 0, 
Raw Materials 0
JOURNEYMAN WORKSHOP (AFTER 15 
YEARS): Innovation 1, Raw Materials 2
MASTER WORKSHOP (AFTER 30 YEARS): 
Innovation 2, Raw Materials 2
Beyond adding to the Craftsman’s 
Craft Ability for the purpose of pro-
ducing quality goods, the workshop is 
something that can be handed on to 
the next generation and as such be-
comes a part of the covenant.
ASSISTANTS
A Craftsman may employ a num-
ber of assistants equal to his Leader-
ship score, though he may always em-
ploy one apprentice regardless of his 
Leadership score. As well as helping in 
the workshop, these assistants may be 
the source of new grogs to replace the 
old over time, and may initiate stories 
of their own.
Each assistant adds half his Craft 
Ability score to the Craftsman’s Work-
shop Total. If using multiple assistants, 
their Craft Scores should ﬁrst be to-
talled and then divided by two.
PERSONALITY TRAITS  
& REPUTATION
A Craftsman supported by a cov-
enant will doubtless be Hard-Work-
ing, but while some may be Kindly or 
Generous, others might be Strict or 
Miserly. The Craftsman should have 
one Personality Trait that determines 
his outlook on his work and another 
that shapes his relationship with his 
apprentices. A third trait can be se-
Craftswomen
Although the Craftsman grog 
archetype describes a craftsman, the 
covenant may have even more to of-
fer the craftswoman. Crafts, trades, and 
their guilds are dominated by men in 
an atmosphere that doesn’t necessar-
ily put women on an equal footing. 
Even those crafts typically associated 
with women rarely organized into 
guilds, which prevented the status 
of such trades from being raised. So 
what chance does the female silver-
smith have to practice her craft?
Thanks largely to the iconoclas-
tic nature of the Order, where men 
and women are, nominally at least, 
afforded equal status without ques-
tion, Craftswomen skilled in any 
craft may ﬁnd employment as easily 
as any man.

Grogs
lected to round out the character.
It is most likely that a Craftsman liv-
ing at a covenant will remain an unsung 
hero, the fruits of his labor obscured 
by the magical enchantments the magi 
bestow upon them. A grog Craftsman 
rarely generates a Reputation concern-
ing his work. Craftsmen designed as 
companion character, as discussed lat-
er, can acquire a strong reputation.
Craftsman as Companion
Craftsman companions are less 
likely to be tied to the covenant and 
may usually pursue their own goals, 
which means that progression into 
and through their craft guild is more 
likely. The City & Guild supplement 
provides a full treatment of playing 
through a guild career, for those with 
Craftsman characters.
Craftsman Story Seeds
The following story seeds have 
a Craftsman at their heart, but they 
present challenges that magi and 
companions may face.
THE APPRENTICE
A Craftsman approaches the 
covenant with something to sell: an 
apprentice. He considers the boy to 
be useless to him, but a wise woman 
told him that there was a touch of 
the magical about him. He wants 
ﬁve pounds for the boy to cover his 
lost earnings and his trouble. The 
apprentice doesn’t have The Gift, 
but it is quickly apparent to the 
magi that his talents are linked to 
the Magic Realm, and that the cov-
enant is the only place in which he 
will reach his potential.
NEITHER APPRENTICE  
NOR MASTER
A new blacksmith comes to the 
covenant looking for work. The ex-
amples he shows are of the highest 
quality and he works far faster than 
the covenant’s current blacksmith. 
With the magi keen to craft ever-
better items and expend less on the 
upkeep of their covenant, do they 
accept this new blacksmith? And if 
they do, how can the displaced grog 
prove that the newcomer’s smithy 
skills aren’t all they appear? (See 
Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 87 
for speciﬁcs on the Corrupted Abili-
ties Flaw.)
THE WORKSHOP
On venturing out to collect vis 
from a prime site on behalf of the 
magi, the grogs ﬁnd that a black-
smith has built a small forge directly 
over the source of their Ignem vis. 
The forge is somewhat makeshift 
and hasn’t been there for long. The 
blacksmith refuses to move on, claim-
ing that this magical place is the only 
thing that helps him feed his family, 
and he is willing to defend himself if 
things get rough. Do the grogs deal 
with the issue and claim the vis or do 
they go back to their masters? Can 
the magi identify the blacksmith’s 
supernatural Flaw, and do they offer 
him a solution that suits everybody?
A NEW GENERATION
An aging covenant Craftsman, 
ailments weighing him down with 
each passing year, regrets never 
having taken an apprentice. These 
feelings are mirrored by one of the 
covenant magi. While the Craftsman 
and a few friends venture outside the 
covenant to ﬁnd a youngster with 
an aptitude for his craft, the magus 
sets out to ﬁnd a Gifted child. After 
false hope given by faeries, does the 
Craftsman ﬁnally ﬁnd his apprentice? 
And can the magus overcome Infer-
nal deception to rescue the Gifted 
child? The stories of both the magus 
and the Craftsman are mirrored in 
their searches, but perhaps the reso-
lution lies in the same place.
A GIFTED APPRENTICE
The problem with covenants is 
that the strange often goes unno-
ticed. One of the magi searches the 
local area for signs of a Gifted child 
that he can take under his wing and 
train in the Hermetic Arts. He learns 
of a craftsman who suspects the abili-
ties of his own apprentice, but this 
craftsman is worried that, should 
wizards hear tell of this, the youth 
will be taken away and subjected 
to unbearable hardship and uncon-
scionable danger. The trail leads 
back to the covenant itself. Why has 
the craftsman really kept this from 
his masters? Does the magus take 
the Gifted apprentice? How do the 
craftsman and the other covenfolk 
react to this?
THE KNOWLEDGEABLE THATCHER
A humble thatcher approaches 
the magi with the aim of discussing 
and learning magic. The man is not 
Gifted and is not even educated, but 
he has been touched by magic. The 
thatcher explains that, while he is a 
simple craftsman, he is able to weave 
magic into the straw he uses. But 
he has ambitions greater than mere 
corn-dollies; he wants to enchant the 
thatch that is his daily trade, some-
thing that so far eludes him. Can the 
magi undertake research to help the 
man expand his power, or are there 
other Learned Magicians better suit-
ed? And where can they be found?

THE SUPERNATURAL CRAFTSMAN
A companion Craftsman has ac-
cess to the Touched by (Realm) Major 
Supernatural Virtue, which in turn al-
lows him to craft Wondrous Items (as 
per the rules in City & Guild, page 70). 
These enchanted items are more lim-
ited in scope than Hermetic enchant-
ments, but they allow the companion 
to develop his own career and reputa-
tion as a craftsman of note. And as the 
character is unGifted, he or she may 
be more easily accepted in society, 
opening up opportunities not avail-
able to magi.
CRAFTSMAN AS ARTIST
Chapter 8 of the Art & Academe 
supplement provides rules for artists 
in Mythic Europe. Production Artists 
use their Craft Abilities, such as Craft: 
Stone Mason, Craft: Glazier, and 
Craft: Silversmith to produce works 
of art that have a value far beyond 
that of a mundane example of a crafts-
man’s work.
This path opens up a whole new 
avenue for the Companion Crafts-
man, one which can take him into 
the richest and most volatile levels of 
society. It also opens up new rules for 
the creation of art and the acquisition 
of new beneﬁts.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Guild Craftsmen will want to look 
at the guild-related virtues and ﬂaws in 
City & Guild, chapter 3. Those looking 
for a Supernatural Craftsmen should 
take the Touched by (Realm) Virtue 
presented in City & Guild, chapter 4. 
Production Artists are discussed in Art 
& Academe, chapter 8, and this includes 
new Virtues for the Maestro Mythic 
Companion character.
Ex-Prostitutes
I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be 
in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more 
than over ninety and nine just persons, which 
need no repentance.
 
 
– The Bible, Luke 15:7
Prostitution is common in the ur-
ban areas of Mythic Europe. Many 
prostitutes have other professions, and 
supplement their income on fair days, 
or by soliciting business from traveling 
merchants when the harvest is poor. In 
cities, however, there are some women 
who work solely as prostitutes, and 
the Church continually exhorts them 
to stop their sinning. Some do.
General Background
When a prostitute repents, she pos-
es a problem for the Church. Her trade 
may have been sinful, but it provided 
an income. Lacking other skills, and 
not a likely prospect for marriage, an 
ex-prostitute often falls back into her 
old ways, begins begging, or becomes 
a petty criminal. Some sections of the 
Church have had success in resettling 
fallen women, using funds provided by 
noblewomen. There are two common 
schemes which may affect a covenant.
Some noblewomen found new 
nunneries with ex-prostitutes as the 
nuns. This sometimes works per-
fectly, sometimes fails due to recidi-
vism, and in some scandalous cases, 
leads to well-disguised brothels. To 
improve the chance of the nunnery 
succeeding, it is often placed far from 
towns, in the wild places that attract 
spring covenants. The leader of a new 
nunnery for fallen women is usually a 
noblewoman retiring from the world. 
In time, ex-prostitutes may rise to 
senior roles in such nunneries, but 
rarely to governance.
A less expensive alternative is to 
give the fallen woman a little money, 
and passage to a town so distant from 
her previous home that she has no 
reputation. This is thought to allow 
her to ﬁnd a husband, and so fade 
into society. This seldom works per-
fectly, because few medieval people 
move towns, so the women seem sus-
picious, and a woman failing to rapid-
ly catch a husband still has few skills 
and needs an income. Resettlement 
is, however, the cheaper method, and 
does give women a fresh start away 
from old acquaintances.
Joining a young covenant is a good 
option for women who want to leave 
the sex trade. Many of the people who 
work for spring covenants are already 
socially marginalized. In many spring 
covenants, people do not discuss their 
pasts. If they do, many have done 
things worse than sex work. 
Magi ruling spring covenants are 
often concerned by a lack of gender 
balance in their servants. This occurs 
because the initial turb of grogs, taken 
to found a covenant in the wilderness, 
is comprised of experienced soldiers, 
usually male. To move from a military 
camp to a community, wives are need-
ed. Women who are penitent petty 
criminals, including ex-prostitutes, 
can often be convinced to leave mun-
dane society for a guaranteed job and 
a fresh start.
Magi may also accept fallen 
women into their community to seek 
favor with the Church and local no-
blewomen. Several older covenants 
have populations descended from 
an initial group of fallen women, 
brought to the site while the cove-
nant was still in spring. These places 
are more welcoming to women who 
have recently left the sex trade than 
mundane communities. 
Covenants that allow prostitutes 
to retire to them can develop poor 
Reputations in surrounding commu-
nities, if the members are not care-
ful. Many have formal structures to 
smooth social integration. In one cov-
enant, for example, each new arrival is

Grogs
treated as the niece of a woman from 
the previous generation of adoptees, 
gaining a new extended family and 
place in the community.
Character Creation
The following notes will assist in 
the creation of characters who worked 
previously as prostitutes.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Characters who have worked as 
prostitutes, and seek employment 
with covenants, usually come from 
the lower classes of Mythic Europe-
an society. Women of higher social 
standing tend to act as mistresses to a 
single powerful lord, and are support-
ed by his arrangements, or by their 
own families. Choose Social Status 
Virtues appropriately.
Many of the other Virtues and 
Flaws appropriate for characters 
working in the sex trade — Gos-
sip, Protection, Social Contacts — 
are lost before play begins, when 
the character leaves her hometown. 
Players should only select Virtues 
and Flaws that the character will use 
in play.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Most prostitutes are from the lower 
classes of urban areas, and have Abilities 
suiting this background. There are so 
many prostitutes, however, that charac-
ters from a wide variety of backgrounds, 
with a broad array of skills, are possible.
TRAINING PACKAGES
If an Ex-Prostitute joins a nunnery, 
she may be a Lay Sister. If she has trav-
eled to a different town, she might pick 
up any career: Laborer, Craftswoman, 
and Servant are the most common, but 
Ex-Prostitute Story Seeds
Ex-Prostitutes can stir up many 
kinds of stories.
A TROUBLESOME FOUNDATION
The magi learn from local farmers 
that a noblewoman has sent survey-
ors to a site near the covenant. Their 
companions investigate, and meet 
the architect. He has been commis-
sioned to design a nunnery. Few cov-
enants want religious establishments 
nearby, so they send a party to in-
vestigate the noblewoman, and see if 
she can be convinced to halt or move 
her foundation.
The noblewoman is elderly and 
wishes to retire from the world, leav-
ing her lands in the hands of her 
son. She will accept a portion of her 
lands as abbess of a new foundation 
for fallen women. She is motivated 
by a desire for a contemplative life, 
a need of something useful to do in 
her retirement, and a spirit of charity. 
The characters can alter her 
plans in several ways. The simplest 
is to offer her ﬁnancial assistance 
in exchange for selecting a distant 
site. This would allow her to cre-
ate a larger nunnery, and aid more 
fallen women. Player characters 
might, instead, recruit the noble-
woman as an administrator, and 
her fallen women as covenfolk. If 
handled carefully, this could earn 
the covenant the gratitude of the 
nobleman, whose revenues would 
not be diminished by land grants, 
while still appearing as an act of 
charity, and so gaining the approval 
of the Church.
THE WRATH OF THE LUSTY
Recidivism in ex-prostitutes has 
many causes, but one is that there are 
demons of lust who prefer they re-
sume their role as snares for the souls 
of men. A covenant full of contrite 
women may attract the attention of 
many Tempters (see Realms of Power: 
The Infernal, page 42). Rules for de-
signing succubus and incubi, a type 
of demon that often hides among sex 
workers, are found on page 55, with 
an example on page 52. They may 
also attract the attention of a more 
powerful sexual demon, who seeks to 
harm the covenant by acting as mis-
tress to a local nobleman and seeding 
hatred against the magi.
The magi may be able to protect 
their covenfolk, but the women have 
a second patron Penitent prostitutes 
are guarded by Saint Mary Magda-
lene. Mary uses many of the tricks of 
medieval saints, like sending visions 
and nightmares, but is also particu-
larly interventionist, and may cause 
shackles to fail, wounds to close, 
and faithful people to be mystically 
transported to safety.
A CONSTERNATION OF FAERIES
Fairies are attracted to people 
who are moving from one life stage 
to another, and this includes peni-
tents. The possibility of repeated 
recidivism, where women cross and 
recross the boundary of what is so-
cially acceptable, is attractive to 
some types of faeries. A community 
of penitent prostitutes may draw 
in sexual faeries like satyrs, who, 
unable to cross the Aegis, trouble 
nearby villages. Centaurs, represent-
ing the division between the bestial 
and cerebral natures of men, may be 
attracted to the community to rede-
ﬁne their roles into fully anthropo-
morphic shapes.

Ex-Prostitute  
as Companion
Ex-Prostitutes who become com-
panion characters differ from their 
sisters not so much in background or 
Ability, but in their fortune in their 
later career, and their inﬂuence in the 
troupe’s stories. Characters who rise to 
a station that they could lose if their 
past were revealed may select the 
Dark Secret Flaw. Characters without 
this Flaw may instead have another 
Story Flaw, ﬂeshing out the character’s 
background further.
Saint Mary Magdalene: A Note For Players
Discussing religious ﬁgures is al-
ways awkward. Troupes are encour-
aged to discuss their level of comfort 
both with the portrayal of ex-pros-
titutes in their game, and their rela-
tionship with Saint Mary Magdalene.
Saint Mary Magdalene is interest-
ing, in that she appears so differently 
to the two halves of medieval Chris-
tianity. In the Catholic west in 1220, 
she is believed to have been an ex-
prostitute, the “sinful woman” in Luke 
who anoints the feet of Jesus, and, 
on a separate occasion, anoints Je-
sus’ head. This is not the belief of the 
modern Catholic Church, who sees 
these three as separate women. In 
medieval literature, she is the patron 
of penitent sex workers and grants 
miracles to aid them. She is also the 
patron of contemplatives, apothecar-
ies, perfumers, hairdressers, reformed 
sinners, and women in general. In ad-
dition, she is also credited with the 
invention of Easter eggs.
In Mythic Europe, a cult in her 
service is spreading through Burgun-
dy, but her cult in Provence has not 
yet reached its historical heights. She 
is seen as the Apostle to the Apostles, 
and the ﬁrst Christian to accept and 
announce the Resurrection.
In the Orthodox east, Mary is be-
lieved to have been a woman of such 
great piety that Satan misidentiﬁed 
her as the Mary who would bear Je-
sus, and sent seven demons to trou-
ble her. She is seen as an equal to the 
apostles. She is a patron of women, 
but not of prostitutes in particular.
Her relics are found in Vézelay in 
Burgundy, and in Constantinople.

The Failed 
Apprentice
I could have been like them, you know. I 
should have been like them! But... that was a 
long time ago, and where else is there for me 
to go?
It is the hope of every magus that 
the apprentice he trains embraces 
the magical teachings of Bonisa-
gus, swears the Oath, and follows 
his master’s path into the Order of 
Hermes. But for some, those hopes 
are dashed, and the apprentice 
proves little more than a broken 
vessel to be discarded and replaced. 
Where should these young students 
go, with the truth of the supernatural 
world revealed to them, and no place 
in mundane society? 
General Background
Robbed of his Gift, but with knowl-
edge of the supernatural and Bonisa-
gus’ theories, the Failed Apprentice 
still has much to offer to a covenant. If 
taken from his parents at a very young 
age, life in a covenant is possibly the 
only life he has ever known. If he 
doesn’t feel he can stay with his for-
mer master, he may seek out another 
covenant, either one that is friendly to 
his own, or one that he knows would 
offend the magus responsible for the 
loss of his Gift.
A Failed Apprentice may ﬁnd 
himself busy in copying and prepar-
ing texts, assisting within the labo-
ratory, or advising covenfolk both at 
home and on their journeys on su-
pernatural matters.
Character Creation
The following notes will help with 
the creation of a Failed Apprentice.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
Apprentices can be taken at any age, 
though magi work hard to ﬁnd them in 
their youth, when they can be molded 
into the image of a magus. A Failed Ap-
prentice joining the covenant upon los-
ing his Gift will probably be younger 
than 25, while one who has traveled 
before ﬁnding his place will be older.
The Failed Apprentice is normally 
intelligent, so as to take the mental 
rigors of a learned life, and hardy to 
withstand the toll of working magic, 
so Intelligence and Stamina should 
be his primary characteristics. Posi-
tive Perception or Dexterity will also 
beneﬁt him, depending on what Su-
pernatural Abilities remain.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
The Failed Apprentice has a num-
ber of Virtues and Flaws that reﬂect 
his magical past, and perhaps hint at a 
magical future.
Failed Apprentice; Latent Magical 
Ability, Magic Sensitivity; Broken 
Vessel*, Missing Eye, Offensive to 
Animals
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
The Failed Apprentice Social Sta-
tus Virtue is apt and gives the character 
access to both Academic and Arcane 
abilities. Latent Magical Ability and 
Magic Sensitivity are the remnants of 
the apprentice’s Gift. The Flaws also 
represent these remnants, with the 
Missing Eye a lasting physical remind-
er, Offensive to Animals echoing the 
effect his Gift once had, and Broken 
Vessel a continuing threat of his magi-
cal powers slipping away from him. 
Alternatively, a Personality Flaw rep-
resenting his continued bad feelings 
about the events that stripped his Gift 
from him would be entirely appropri-
ate in place of a physical defect.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
A Failed Apprentice would have 
been tutored in academic and arcane 
knowledge until his Gift deserted 
him. Beyond that, he can take and 
improve any Abilities that his back-
ground suggests.

tice has also researched ﬁve Formu-

PERSONALITY TRAITS
A Failed Apprentice may be An-
gry, Bitter, or Resentful over whatever 
took his Gift from him. The experi-
ence may have made him either Pes-
simistic or Resolute in the face of new 
challenges. But in either case, he may 
approach life with a new Worldly-
Wise aspect.
Failed Apprentice  
as Companion
Grogs have a limited number of 
slots open for Virtues and Flaws and so 
Failed Apprentice Story Seeds
The following story seeds origi-
nate with the Failed Apprentice and 
he certainly appears as a prominent 
character, but they are designed 
with magus and companion charac-
ters in mind.
A GIFT RETURNED BROKEN
A magus Bonisagi has fostered 
his apprentice out to another magus, 
just as House Bonisagus tradition 
dictates. But the apprentice suddenly 
returns to the covenant with a letter 
from the fostering magus. It seems a 
magical experiment has robbed the 
boy of his Gift. What does the ma-
gus do now? Can he force compensa-
tion for the loss? How can he replace 
the apprentice? And what becomes 
of the young student with so much 
stolen from him?
A NEW TRADITION
A wizard from a hedge magic 
tradition searching for an appren-
tice of his own hears tell of a student 
damaged by his association with the 
Order. He offers to take the boy and 
teach him in his own way. But there’s 
one problem: the wizard is under 
threat from an antagonistic Flam-
beau, and if the boy goes with the 
wizard, his life is at risk too.
A SECOND CHANCE
A faerie fortune teller accosts the 
failed apprentice while at market and 
offers a chance to wield magic again. 
But three tasks are laid out, which the 
apprentice must complete. The ﬁrst 
is to rescue the “pining heart of the 
unforgotten woman.” The second is 
to “capture the tears of the resolute 
man.” And the third is to “reunite the 
distant lovers, in marriage, before 
three moons are done.” If these three 
tasks can be accomplished, then the 
apprentice will know magic again. 
The fortune teller offers little advice, 
except that the woman will be found 
in a castle, in Acre, far across the sea. 
And one last thing: the fortune teller 
gives the apprentice a golden ring, 
with the assurance that “by this ring 
will she know you.”
THE SEED
An ancient magus, known to 
have visions and premonitions, tells 
the covenant that a powerful Gift 
may soon be born to the covenant. 
Deciphering his visions, the magi 
discern that the bookish Failed Ap-
prentice is to be the father, and the 
mother is to be the somewhat ro-
bust cook, widow to the former turb 
captain. Can the magi bring these 
two together? Is love even within 
the power of the magi? Or will they 
need expert faerie assistance?
A MUNDANE MASTER
The old Failed Apprentice, ﬁnally 
tired of life at the covenant, leaves. 
Having taken minor orders and calling 
himself a clerk, he ﬁnds a position as 
an advisor on supernatural matters to 
a nearby noble. But then the old man 
sends word to his former covenant 
that the noble is a potential threat to 
them. How does the covenant investi-
gate? And has the old man’s disloyalty 
already been discovered?

Grogs
have a limited range of Supernatural 
Abilities open to them. Companions 
and Mythic Companions may take 
more of these. They may also take 
Story Flaws relating to the events, per-
haps Plagued by Supernatural Entity, 
or even Dark Secret, in addition to a 
Magical Air.
The Farrier
Some say an army marches on 
its stomach. But an army of horses 
marches very poorly indeed without 
proper hoof care, or if not profession-
ally shod. An expert in this ﬁeld is a 
prized asset in any army, caravan, or 
covenant. The Farrier is an important 
professional, needed wherever horses 
are in use. He is more craftsman than 
animal wrangler. While regular stable 
boys and groomsmen take care of 
the day-to-day tending and the hard 
labor of fetching water and mucking 
out the stables, the Farrier has more 
specialized skills. His primary area of 
expertise is caring for horses’ hooves 
and ﬁtting horseshoes, as well as gen-
eral equine veterinary skills. The vil-
lage blacksmith might have wrought 
the shoe, and could shoe the horse, 
if need be. But the Farrier can adapt, 
modify, and ﬁt it optimally. Where 
many horses need care, a specialized 
Farrier is of great value. Some people 
even attribute to a good Farrier super-
natural abilities; this may or may not 
be the case.
General Background
A wholly mundane Farrier could 
be the usual misﬁt or tragic ﬁgure, a 
person having lost everything or fallen 
to the bottom rung of society. Alter-
natively, he could be a person who 
has made enemies of nobles or been 
shunned by the craft guild. Such a 
character could easily be lured by a se-
cure, free, and comfortable position at 
a well-off covenant.
A supernaturally aligned Farrier 
could either be shunned by society in 
general and by the Church in particu-
lar, or be harassed or sought after by 
magi, hedge wizards, or supernatural 
beings. And as such, only a covenant 
with a fair Aegis of the Hearth offers any 
real sanctuary. Depending on the su-
pernatural abilities of the Farrier, cov-
enants and magi could be anything 
from mildly to very interested. Small, 
mundane enhancements of quality, or 
even magical abilities, are great boons 
to the riders of a covenant turb. And 
this is nothing to the advantages a 
Mercer House could gain for their 
Redcaps.
Character Creation
The following notes provide guid-
ance on creating a Farrier.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Virtues might include: Animal 
Ken, Craft Guild Training*, Mythic 
Farrier*, Puissant (Craft: Farrier)
Flaws might include: Curse of 
Slander*, Imagined Folk Tradition 
Vulnerability*, Independent Crafts-
man, Necessary (Realm) for (Ability), 
Vulnerable to Folk Tradition
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
SOCIAL STATUS
Craftsman 
seems 
the 
logical 
choice, although Wanderer or Out-
cast is appropriate for a newcomer or a 
troubled individual, or Covenfolk for 
a long-term employee.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Suggested abilities are: Animal 
Handling, Craft: Farrier, Craft: Black-
smith, Bargain.
New Ability: Craft: Farrier (General)
This is the professional skill of 
hoof care and shoeing horses. It 
differs from Animal Handling by 
focusing on horses, and by expand-
ing the knowledge of serious care 
of hooves, teeth and legs. It is also 
more craft-oriented, as it includes 
the skills needed to modify and 
adapt horseshoes made by a black-
smith. It may be used instead of 
Animal Handling or Medicine to 
cure equine disease; the farrier has 
a +1 bonus to resolve it, increasing 
to +3 if it concerns the feet, com-
pared to somebody using Animal 
Handling. Many farriers also have 
Craft: Blacksmith, expanding their 
expertise to making horseshoes 
from raw iron as well as other iron-
working skills.
Note that the rules from City & 
Guild for craft quality (page 67) al-
low for the farrier to make high 
quality horseshoes. A Craft Total of 
12 makes Superior items, giving a 
+1 bonus for a single feature. This 
could cover only some of the typical 
Riding specialties: speed, sureness 
of foot, trample damage, jumping 
skill, etc.. Horseshoes cannot by 
mundane means affect other spe-
cialties, like ease of control or en-
durance, but a Mythic Farrier could 
work magic into the shoes. A Craft 
total of 15 or more makes Excellent 
items, giving a bonus to all uses of a 
single Ability of +1 or more, limited 
to [Craft Ability]/3.

Farrier Story Seeds
These story seeds feature a Far-
rier as a central character.
TIPPING THE SCALES
The covenant’s scouts report that 
an ongoing, armed conﬂict is not 
only escalating, but the enemy is 
getting the upper hand. The turb is 
losing the battle due to the swiftness 
and responsiveness of the enemy’s 
cavalry. Rumor has it that an excel-
lent farrier moved to the neighbor-
ing village just last year, but strange 
things are said about him. Whether 
or not he is evil incarnate, he is said 
to possess almost supernatural abili-
ties. The magi want to enlist his help, 
voluntarily or not. But he is not so 
easily coerced, and further study re-
veals that he is in fact in the employ-
ment of the enemy. Thus, his recruit-
ment becomes doubly important; not 
only can he improve the covenant’s 
cavalry, his services will also be de-
nied to the enemy. But beware, as he 
is easily spooked and may bolt and 
all but disappear. Retracing his past 
steps shows that he moves yearly, 
and always ends up with a poor repu-
tation. Do the magi really want such 
a troublemaker in their midst?
PLAYING THE PART
In the course of an adventure, a 
group of magi and their retinue come 
across a somewhat strange noble 
court, in the middle of the wilderness. 
The archetypical courtiers and retain-
ers found there, as well as the ﬂawless 
castle, quickly reveal out the fay. But 
it is too late, the characters are already 
caught up in a faerie story of court in-
trigue, romance and tragic dueling. 
Regrettably, the court is inhabited by 
dark faeries, who are sore losers in-
deed. Some of the lower-ranking fay 
even stoop to cheating, a thing im-
mediately punished by the lord, but 
the setbacks to the player characters’ 
situation remain. Eventually, one of 
the court servants turns out to be a 
faerie-touched human, serving as sta-
ble master. He has been held prisoner, 
but tolerated it, while learning from 
the faerie smith. But now he is fed 
up, and wants to leave. He offers to 
help the characters to steal the fastest 
faerie horses, and hamper the lord’s 
hunting party. However, the ensuing 
hunt is tricky, since the dark forest is 
still to a certain degree controlled by 
the faerie lord.
A PAWN SAVED 
IS A PAWN OWNED
A maga is tasked with setting 
up a Mercer house at her covenant, 
in order to secure the best possible 
mounts for the Redcaps. The orders 
are clear, the task is rushed along, 
but the resources are lagging. The 
covenant lacks a great deal of the 
resources due to other pressing mat-
ters or vis shortages. However, the 
covenant has a Mythic Farrier in 
its service, and the maga sees great 
opportunities. Signiﬁcantly, a lot of 
what she thought she needed magic 
and vis for can be done by this sim-
ple craftsman. Can he be convinced 
to do with his skills what might have 
needed Hermetic magic?

Farrier as Companion
Using the Farrier concept as a com-
panion gives even more reason to play 
with the supernatural side of it. The 
increased range of Virtues possible al-
lows Mythic Farrier to be expanded 
with a second form, or even replaced 
by the Touched by [Realm] Major 
Virtue in order to avoid some of the 
restrictions of the Minor version (City 
& Guild, page 71). Furthermore, Puis-
sant (Ability), Afﬁnities, Increased, 
or Great Characteristic can boost the 
potential Craft Totals considerably. 
Various Social Status Virtues from 
City & Guild could improve the Farrier’s 
place in society and his workshop, 
and possibly give him the beneﬁts of 
assistants. But the main idea is mak-
ing him a character worth playing and 
bringing along on adventures, instead 
of having him just hammer away in 
his shop. Investing in the Arcane Lore 
Virtue would make him a ﬁne choice 
to bring along when investigating ex-
otic locales for minerals — for him to 
use in his horseshoes — or for super-
naturally aligned riding beasts.
The Jack-of-
All-Trades
No problem at all. I was apprenticed to a 
mason before I went on campaign with Duke 
Tybol. Of course, that was after my brief stint 
in the circus. I’ll soon have that bridge ﬁxed, 
and we can be on our way.
Everybody knows someone like 
this character. He is the sort of person 
who has never managed to hold down 
a single job for too long. He has no 
idea what he wants to do with his life, 
and he drifts from place to place, never 
remaining long enough to learn any-
thing that might earn him a living. He 
might have begun as a baker’s appren-
tice, but then enrolled into university 
dreaming of becoming a famous aca-
demician. Once those dreams fade, 
he enlists in the army, until his unit is 
disbanded and he is turned out pen-
niless onto the streets. This prompts 
him to engage in a larcenous career 
until he has stolen enough to invest in 
a trade...and so on and so forth. Over 
the course of a life like this, a charac-
ter can accumulate a vast array of dif-
ferent skills, but he will never be good 
enough in any one Ability to make 
a career out of it: a true jack-of-all-
trades, but master of none.

themselves; most peasants take on their 
fathers’ profession, or that of the mas-
ter to whom they are apprenticed. For 
someone from a humble background 
to become a Jack-of-All-Trades, some-
thing else must have driven him from 
home and prevented him from set-
tling down. This might be as simple as 
a wanderlust, a thirst to see the world 
and witness new experiences that 
drives him ever onwards. Alternatively, 
he might make others uncomfortable 
due to poor hygiene, odious personal 
habits, outspoken beliefs, or a gener-
al aura of wrongness. Finally, he may 
carry some sort of curse or bad luck 
that discourages anyone from wanting 
to become his friend, for fear of being 
caught up in the backlash. This could 
be a very lonely or pitiful character.
Despite mundane society having 
little use for a character who can-
not manage to master a single trade, 
such a character can prove a boon 
to a covenant. Here, his very lack of 
focus can be a blessing to a turb, and 
he can ﬁnd himself being paid purely 
because of his eclectic collection of 
knowledge and skills. When on expe-
dition, a soldier who has the Abilities 
of Single Weapon, Craft: Cook, and 
Etiquette, in addition to being able to 
speak French and Ancient Greek and 
debate Philosophiae, can be of great 
value to a magus. He might not be the 
best warrior in the world, but his other 
Abilities more than make up the dif-
ference in the eyes of the covenant.
Character Creation
What follows are notes to help cre-
ate Jack-of-All-Trades characters.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
First, decide why the character 
has been unable to stay in one place; 
this could be due to any of the fol-
lowing Flaws: Craving for Travel*, 
Jinxed*, Lesser Malediction, Un-
lucky*, Social Handicap, or Tainted 
with Evil. The character should have 
at least one, and possibly two Vir-
tues, allowing him to take Academic, 
Arcane, or Martial Abilities, and is 
likely to have extra experience points 
from Virtues such as Privileged Up-
bringing or Well-Traveled. The char-
acter probably does not have Puis-
sant (Ability), Afﬁnity with (Ability), 
or any other Virtue that indicates a 
particular focus, but the Jack-of-All-
Trades* Virtue is highly appropriate. 
A character like this could be totally 
Carefree about his lack of focus and 
direction, or he could be depressed 
and Pessimistic instead. The Master 
of None* and Careless with Ability* 
Flaws represent a character who is 
mediocre at a lot of things, but highly 
unspecialized. 
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Just about any Ability suits this 
character concept, and he is likely 
possessed of a number of Abilities 
that are unusual ones for grogs to 
have, such as Etiquette or Artes Libe-
rales. It is likely that he is a soldier 
at base, which would enhance his 
usefulness in a turb by being able to 
turn his hand to anything, in addition 
to being able to ﬁght as part of the 
trained group.
Jack-of-All-Trades Story Seeds
A Jack-of-All-Trades character 
can end up embroiled in just about 
any kind of story.
THE PERILS OF OVER-RELIANCE
A covenant has a contested vis 
source whose method of collection 
changes every year; for example, 
a magical sphinx poses a different 
challenge every year. The Jack-
of-All-Trades can usually be relied 
upon to gather the vis, since he can 
meet most challenges. However, 
the grog fails to return from one of 
his regular trips from the covenant, 
and the covenant has a dilemma. If 
they go ahead with the yearly task, 
they have a higher probability of 
failure, and may well be too late to 
save their valuable grog from what-
ever peril he has found himself in. 
However, if they devote resources 
to his rescue, they might allow oth-
ers to capitalize on their failure. 
And what predicament is the grog 
in anyway? Perhaps he has been 
imprisoned by the covenant’s en-
emy in an attempt to weaken them 
or extract information. Or maybe 
it is simply an accident.
A PROBLEM SHARED IS  
A PROBLEM INHERITED
The player characters ﬁrst come 
across a jinxed grog as he struggles 
with a wagon that has broken an 
axle and is blocking the road. The 
quickest way to get by is to assist 
the ﬂustered individual to reload his 
cargo and help repair his employ-
er’s wagon. However, the spilled 
load has angered a local faerie — 
perhaps it was a consignment of 
iron horseshoes for the local town 
— and the faerie is incapable of 
distinguishing the responsible indi-
vidual (the grog) from those who 
help him (the player characters). 
Throughout the course of their 
shared misfortune, the grog proves 
himself to be resourceful, and since 
he is probably going to be out of 
a job anyway (he’s frightfully late 
with this cargo), he asks if there 
is perhaps a job for him with the 
player characters.

TRAINING PACKAGES
The character is likely to have 
taken several three-year packages, 
representing ﬂitting from job to job 
in the course of his career. Just about 
any package is possible. He probably 
has spent the most time in professions 
providing Martial Abilities.

Jack-of-All-Trades  
as Companion
A companion character might 
have a Story Flaw that prevents her 
from settling down, such as Enemies 
or Plagued by Supernatural Entity. 
With more Virtue points available, a 
companion character might be able to 
get a score in all possible Abilities, and 
can pick multiple Virtues that offer 
extra experience points to represent 
the wealth of experience that she has 
gathered over her years of wandering.
A grog Jack-of-All-Trades could 
easily blossom into a companion char-
acter by ﬁnally settling down into a 
trade — and discovering that she is re-
markably good at it. This sort of Inau-
guration transformation might bring 
with it a number of Virtues which de-
scribe one’s new-found excellence in 
a particular Ability, such as Puissant 
(Ability) and Cautious with (Ability).
Misguided 
Mystic
I’m getting a letter ‘D’...it’s an old man...
does that have any meaning to you, dearie? 
He’s holding his chest, as if it hurts...was he 
elf-shot perhaps? No? Not familiar?...maybe 
the spirits are saying ‘B,’ not ‘D’...
Not everyone who claims mystical 
insight has actually been touched by a 
higher power. True prophecy is excep-
tionally rare, and most street-corner 
“prophets” are charlatans or mentally 
deranged. Religious zealots might un-
dergo ordeals in order to gain a glimpse 
of the Divine Plan. Occasionally, how-
ever, individuals arise who did not seek 
out their visions, and are neither mad 
nor attempt to make a proﬁt from their 
predictions. Such individuals often re-
ject their unnatural insights, and keep 
them hidden from their families and 
friends for years. Alternatively they 
may have a single conﬁdante, who un-
wittingly lets slip his friend’s miracu-
lous abilities, and she becomes a minor 
local celebrity. Of course, occasionally 
even con men and madmen can have 
real powers of prediction.
The form that these visions takes 
varies from individual to individual, 
and there are many types of “mystical” 
powers available in Mythic Europe. 
Seeing the unseen (Second Sight) is 
perhaps the most common ability, and 
the ﬁnding of lost things (Dowsing) 
and prescience of danger (Premoni-
tions) are nearly as common.
Perhaps the most pitiful — and 
potentially dangerous — of charac-
ters is one who has a deﬁnite mystical 
power, but misunderstands it. A char-
acter might see the impressions from 
her Second Sight as hallucinations 
warning of danger. If she is sensitive 
to magical impressions, she can eas-
ily misinterpret these impressions as 
an ability to sniff out evil, particularly 
if she encounters Gifted characters. If 
she is known for her abilities among 
her neighbors, this could cause great 
troubles for a group of magi.
Eventually, the Misguided Mystic 
can get into trouble when others dis-
cover her powers, real or imagined. 
If they appear benign, she might be 
hounded by those seeking predictions 
and asked for things that she cannot 
provide. If her powers have had a more 
negative reception, she may be chased

Grogs
out of town as a witch. A covenant can 
offer refuge to one with these talents.
Character Creation
These are suggestions for the cre-
ation of Misguided Mystic characters.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
This character is likely to have the 
Wise One Social Status, unless she has 
kept her “powers” a secret. The Mis-
guided Mystic could have actual oracu-
lar powers in the form of Supernatural 
Virtues, of which the following are par-
ticularly appropriate: Dowsing, Magic 
Sensitivity, 
Premonitions, 
Second 
Sight, and Sense Holiness & Unholi-
ness. When taking one of these Vir-
tues, the player should decide to which 
Realm of Power the Ability is aligned 
and describe why. Aligning to the Di-
vine Realm is perhaps the most useful, 
but this would require the character to 
be pious, at least. Aligning to a Realm 
of Power could result in the (Realm) 
Stigmatic* Flaw. A character with more 
than one Supernatural Virtue need not 
align them all to the same realm. 
Rather than any actual power, 
the grog might instead have a Latent 
Magic Ability, and her prophetic abili-
ties might develop over time. Alter-
natively, she could be afﬂicted by the 
Hallucinations* Flaw, and her powers 
wholly delusory. A character who has 
made correct prophecies in the past 
that had some major impact on the lo-
cal landscape might have the Famous 
Virtue, or else the Infamous Flaw, if 
things did not go so well.
A Misguided Mystic might be con-
fused as to what her visions are tell-
ing her. She might have both Magic 
Sensitivity and Sense Holiness & Un-
holiness, but be unable to tell them 
apart, or have both the Visions and 
Hallucinations* Flaws. Characters af-
ﬂicted with the Falling Evil* are com-
monly believed to be touched by a 
supernatural power when they have a 
ﬁt, although this Flaw is not available 
to grog characters. A Misguided Mys-
tic may have other Personality Flaws 
that hint at mental instability: Com-
pulsion, Fear, Obsessed, or Weakness. 
All Virtues and Flaws marked with an 
asterisk are described in this book.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
This character can probably take 
Arcane Abilities at character cre-
ation, and usually has a decent score 
in a particular (Realm) Lore. Leader-
ship is a useful Ability for expound-
ing one’s prophecies to the masses, as 
is Folk Ken. The character does not 
need Guile unless she is deliberately 
deceiving her audience. Apart from 
these Abilities, and any Supernatural 
Abilities she might have, the Mis-
guided Mystic has Abilities appropri-
ate to the career she followed before 
her visions started. It is wise to pick 
Abilities that make the character of 
sufﬁcient use to the magi for her to be 
employed by them.
TRAINING PACKAGES
Training packages for Misguided 
Mystics include: Local, Cunning Man, 
Conman, Mystic, Storyteller.
SAMPLE ABILITY SCORES
This character must be able to take 
Arcane Abilities at character creation. 
No Supernatural Abilities have been 
included; increase her age to get suf-
ﬁcient experience points.

Misguided Mystic  
as Companion
The Misguided Mystic can be 
made into a companion character by 
putting her in touch with a higher 
power. The Visions Story Flaw is an 
excellent way to achieve this; not only 
are the visions true, but they also drag 
the character into stories. True pro-
phetic power only comes from the Di-
vine (Realms of Power: The Divine, page 
54), but there are non-Divine powers 
that could be useful to an oracle, such 
as Divination and Augury (The Mys-
teries Revised Edition, page 58) and the 
Dream Power (Realms of Power: Faerie, 
page 126). Even without overt powers 
of prediction, there are several Super-
natural Abilities that ﬁt very well with 
this character concept, and a compan-
ion character could take two or more 
of the Abilities listed earlier.
A grog character — particularly 
one with Latent Magic Ability — 
could transform into a companion 
character through some sort of mystic 
revelation, or exposure to a source of 
powerful magic.
The Murderer
I know they say what I done was wrong, 
but I’d do it again, I would. An’ I’d look into 
‘is eyes while doin’ it too.
The covenants established and 
managed by magi of the Order seem 
to suspend some of the normal rules 
of the world around them. Whether 
by negotiated charter or the power 
to impose their will, covenants man-
age their own affairs within their own 
walls. And this de facto sanctuary at-
tracts those that the outside world 
might dispose of, those like thieves 
and murderers.
Misguided Mystic Story Seeds
A character who regularly misin-
terprets genuine signs of the super-
natural is likely to complicate many 
stories, even when she doesn’t cause 
them.
LET IT BURN
The player characters are pass-
ing through a town one day, and 
they witness a woman being placed 
into the stocks. If they ask about her, 
they’ll be told she has been spouting 
nonsense about the town burning 
down. If the characters need help in 
paying attention to this event, then 
she might shriek out a random piece 
of “prophecy” that strikes a particu-
lar chord with one of the magi. Sure 
enough, later that day the town 
starts to burn, and the characters 
might become involved in saving 
it. However, the ﬁre was set by the 
woman’s grown son, who has been 
secretly fulﬁlling her prophecies so 
that she does not seem to be a fool. 
He may have gone too far this time; 
the townsfolk who have lost their 
homes are clamoring for the woman 
to be tried as a witch. Should the 
characters step in to save her, then 
she will have no place in the town 
following her rescue, and her skills 
could prove useful at the covenant.
CRY WOLF
After a while, the magi grow 
used to the misguided mystic’s fre-
quent and inaccurate predictions 
of doom. However, she suddenly 
acquires an infallible sense of the 
future, correctly predicting that the 
cook will spoil the dinner, that the 
chambermaid’s cat will be found in 
the chimney of the great hall, and 
that the seamstress is having an affair 
with the doorward. The magi might 
be interested in her new-found 
prophetic ability; could it be the 
stars, or the inﬂuence of faeries — 
or worse, demons — or something 
else? While they are investigating, 
she predicts that the covenant will 
burn, and an unspeciﬁed magus will 
perish in the blaze. Can this predic-
tion be thwarted by discovering the 
source of the oracular knowledge?

Grogs
General Background
This grog is an unrepentant mur-
derer. He sought sanctuary in the 
covenant having heard of a place 
where secrets stay secret, and where 
a man’s worth is measured by what 
he does today, and not the crimes of 
yesterday. Whatever the reason for 
his past crimes, a crime of passion, an 
argument that turned to violence, or 
an act of vengeance, deep down he 
knows that he would do it again in 
the same situation. And this prevents 
his true repentance. He has had to ﬂee 
those he once knew, unable to return 
for fear of being caught and punished 
for what he has done. The covenant is 
his only hope.
The Murderer works hard to 
make himself useful in the covenant, 
taking on every job and chore that 
he can, trying to secure a position 
for that fateful day when his secret is 
ﬁnally discovered.
Character Creation
These notes will help in creating a 
Murderer character.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
A man may be driven to murder at 
any age, and any man may be driven 
to it. Because of this, there is no par-
ticular age or set of characteristics that 
deﬁne him. However, a man looking 
to extend his sanctuary will ﬁnd a 
way to make himself useful around 
the covenant, probably taking on any 
menial tasks that present themselves. 
So he’ll probably have a high Dexter-
ity so that he’s good with his hands, 
and at least a positive Strength and 
Stamina, representing his determina-
tion to work hard.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
While the Murderer has found a 
place for himself within the covenant, 
he is still damned for the crimes that 
drove him there, and a reputation has 
followed him. The Virtues and Flaws 
that follow are appropriate for a Mur-
derer working as a jack-of-all-trades 
at the covenant: Covenfolk, Good 
Teacher, Puissant Brawl, Tough; Mani-
fest Sin*, Infamous, Master of None*
Murderer Story Seeds
A Murderer character is sure to 
cause trouble wherever he goes.
SANCTUARY
A local knight comes to the cove-
nant looking for a man ﬂeeing justice 
for a murder. The man has been spot-
ted and the knight demands that he 
is handed over. The Murderer, who 
by this time has become a useful and 
popular member of the covenfolk, 
pleads for sanctuary. The magi and 
their deputies must balance external 
politics against the opinion of their 
own people.
VENGEANCE
After all these long years, a sin 
thought forgotten is revisited upon 
the covenant. The victim’s son comes 
looking for the man who did him 
such wrong. And he brings allies. 
The allies he rides with are rivals to 
the covenant, looking to use the situ-
ation to force a minor victory over 
the covenant. Do the magi turn the 
killer over to his accuser, or risk fur-
ther political problems at the hands 
of their enemies?
THE MIND OF A KILLER
A magus has reached a plateau 
in his study of the Art of Mentem, 
or the knowledge of Philosophiae. 
To push his work onwards, he has 
decided he needs to examine a dam-
aged mind, and he has heard of a 
murderer given sanctuary in a nearby 
covenant. Can the magus gain access 
to the murderer? And how does the 
season of study affect both the ma-
gus and his subject?
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY
A guild master in the nearby 
town seems to know too much 
about the magical crafting of the 
covenant’s magus of House Verdi-
tius and is bringing unwanted at-
tention to the covenant. As fortune 
would have it, there is a man living 
in the covenant who has the dark 
streak necessary for the job. The 
magus’ venditor has planned the hit, 
and the Murderer must carry it out. 
But have the magi really ordered 
this, or is there something else in-
ﬂuencing the venditor?
REPENTANCE
The Murderer contracts a disease 
that rapidly delivers him at death’s 
door. With so little time left to him, 
the unrepentant killer must now ﬁnd 
a way to cleanse his soul. With all 
the power at their disposal, will the 
magi help him? If all the ministra-
tions of the Church cannot save the 
man, can they attract the attention of 
a higher power?

Grogs
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
This suggests a character with a 
dark crime in his past, not made for 
a martial life, but who nonetheless 
knows how to take care of himself.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
A killer on the run may come 
from any background, but a grog 
is most often of a lowly status. As 
such, he may have any Abilities his 
Virtues allow, but his reputation and 
conﬁnement to the covenant may 
limit the Abilities he can advance. In 
later years, he makes a good teacher, 
passing on his numerous skills to a 
younger generation.
TRAINING PACKAGES
The following packages are ap-
propriate for hard-working covenfolk 
with particular trade: Brawler, Coven-
folk, Craftsman, Laborer, Local, Ser-
vant, Tinker.
However, the Murderer, with his 
Master-Of-None Flaw, must apply his 
experience points to a different Abili-
ty each season of the year. This means 
that the packages must be adjusted 
so that they each put experience into 
four different Abilities rather than the 
more usual three.

priate for a menial jack-of-all-trades

PERSONALITY TRAITS  
& REPUTATIONS
The Murderer may be conﬂicted, 
feeling Guilty and Unrepentant in 
equal measure, but a character ﬂeeing 
his crime to the safety of a covenant is 
likely to have overcome his guilt and 
be more Self-Preserving. He may be 
Brave, but not the extent that he will 
face up to his crimes.
He also has a Local Reputation as 
a murderer. If the Infamous Flaw has 
also been taken, this starts with a score 
of 4.
Murderer as Companion
A grog created using this arche-
type does not have access to the Dark 
Secret Story Flaw, so his crime(s) are 
known from the outset. A Companion 
character has the option to hide his 
crime and have the secret revealed 
over the course of play. There is also 
more scope for Companions to take

dane and supernatural repercussions

The Parent of  
a Gifted Child
Where he goes, I go.
The potential for a child to be born 
with The Gift within the mundane 
populace is vastly higher than among 
the relatively small numbers of magi. 
Children with The Gift are rare, and 
they are born to parents who come 
from all walks of life, social back-
grounds, and abilities. It is safe to say 
that most apprentices will come from 
the peasants, as they are more numer-
ous than the other social classes.
Raising a child with The Gift is a 
difﬁcult task. The Gifted child might 
be fully formed, and well-presented 
in all ways, but The Gift still has a 
negative effect on people and animals. 
While not immune to The Gift, lov-
ing parents may grow to be used to the 
Gifted child’s strange air. People who 
are close to the family may accept 
the child with all his strangeness, but 
there are always strangers who feel re-
pulsed in some way or another. There 
may even be rumors of witchcraft and 
demonic possession. This causes the 
parents of the child no end of discom-
fort. On the one hand, they love their 
child. On the other, their child is inad-
vertently causing trouble in the com-
munity. The parents may move around 
the country if they have the freedom 
to do so, but many do not due to their 
social status. 
It then comes as a relief when a 
learned scholar comes by, and wants 
the child as an apprentice. The scholar, 
who also has The Gift, promises to keep 
their child safe as well as feed, clothe, 
and educate him. He even offers to buy 
the child. The parents, while happy 
with the idea of the apprenticeship, 
are still under the effects of The Gift, 
and don’t fully trust the magus. So they 
choose to join the covenant. 
The new apprentice’s parents ben-
eﬁt most covenants. New covenants 
gain at least one new grog, and an 
older covenant has the beneﬁt of an 
all-purpose grog to free a special-
ist grog from general duties. Within 
the covenant, the parents continue to 
care for their child outside his peri-
ods of study. It may well be that the 
care of the other apprentices will also 
fall to them. In addition, while hav-
ing no combat skills at all, they make 
adequate guides from having traveled 
extensively throughout at least two 
regions, and may add some vital skills 
Story Seeds for Parents of a Gifted Child
Parents of a Gifted Child are gen-
erally involved in stories surrounding 
their child.
HIDE AND SEEK
Someone out in the populace is 
spreading the word about the evils 
of the Order of Hermes. The words 
“child sacriﬁce” and “murder” are 
used. He is building a following of 
torch-wielding peasants, and it is 
only a matter of time before he turns 
on the covenant. There is also a ru-
mor that the peasants have captured a 
young mage. The magi and compan-
ions are too obvious to try a rescue. 
The magus’ mundane parent and the 
other grogs must try their best. 
THE BAD MASTER
Characters hear the story of a pair 
of distraught parents. Their child had 
been stolen by what sounds like a fel-
low magus. Upon hearing the magus’ 
name, however, the characters know 
that the magus is infamous for misus-
ing his apprentices by teaching them 
little, and using them as virtual lab 
slaves. Rescue may be a relatively 
easy task, if there is a Bonisagus in 
the covenant. However, on hearing 
the intentions of the characters to 
keep the child after rescue, the par-
ents insist on coming along to stay 
close to the child. Also, the charac-
ters have made a powerful enemy of 
the magus.
THE PEDDLER’S GIFT
Working as a purchase agent 
for the covenant, the peddler-grog 
can deal in all sorts of interesting 
trinkets, and would be particularly 
interested in magical goods. With 
his own money, the peddler buys 
a gift for his child from a mysteri-
ous man, thinking the Gifted child 
would be happy with such a gift 
from the once-impoverished father. 
However, the gift is in fact a device 
from an enemy, designed to annoy, 
scry, or even put the covenant in 
danger. Instead of attacking a ma-
gus as intended, the poor apprentice 
suffers the magical device’s effects. If 
the peddler does not have a Gifted 
child, then normal business transac-
tions could land the device in the 
covenant’s hands, although full magi 
may be a little more wary. 
THE LOST PARENT
A character has just run his 
Gauntlet. While he undertook his 
challenge, his parent was sent with 
a group of grogs to a neighboring 
covenant, with a delivery of books 
to trade for vis. The grogs never re-
turned, however. The magi of the 
covenant send the newly Gauntleted 
magi to investigate.

Grogs
or even money-making abilities to 
the covenant. For example, an apia-
rist may add money, food, medicine, 
and possibly even unclaimed vis to 
the covenant. 
The main role of the parents is that 
of support. They do the jobs that spe-
cialist grogs are too busy to perform, 
such as mending pots or ﬁxing roofs. 
In lean times, they have the skills to as-
sist the covenant hunters by foraging. 
In a covenant with a limited number 
of staff, they may double as personal 
servants or housekeepers. These grogs 
would really shine as the covenant’s 
main provider of food. Depending on 
space, and some general labor, they 
can raise crops, and animals for food or 
trade. They are also equipped to bar-
gain for food from the local peasantry. 
Character Creation 
The following notes will assist in 
the creation of a Parent of a Gifted 
Child character.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES 
The parents of a child with The 
Gift can come from a wide variety of 
backgrounds. They are just as likely to 
be an annoyance to the covenant as a 
boon, but will most likely have skills 
and attributes that can be set up or 
packed up easily for a life of travel. As 
such, the Craft and Profession abilities 
have been left open for customization.

The Refugee 
Librarian
Listen to me, we’re here now and there’s no 
going back. Just be thankful we have a home 
again and serve these new masters as they de-
serve, for they have taken us in when no one 
else would.
When a magus or a covenant falls, 
the loss is not only one to the Order 
but is most keenly felt by the coven-
folk. Suddenly, they ﬁnd themselves 
without their masters, without protec-
tion, and without income. Those serv-
ing a fallen covenant face ﬁnding new 
mundane lords, or trekking out to join 
another covenant.

Grogs
General Background
Magi, covenants, and practitio-
ners of hedge magic all have secrets, 
and their servants are likely to ac-
quire some of the more peripheral 
knowledge over time. In particular, 
grogs who accompanied their magi 
to the secret sites of initiation, or to 
collect vis, or consult powerful super-
natural spirits are immediately useful. 
And those tasked with less adventur-
ous duties, such as librarians, scribes, 
stewards, and forge companions, may 
also have valuable information, such 
as cyphers to the personal codes used 
by their magi, records of meetings and 
agreements made by the covenant, 
and details of mundane entanglements 
that a new covenant could exploit. 
The ﬂeeing covenfolk may also bring 
enchanted items with them; indeed, 
for some kinds of the dissolution, this 
is quite likely.
Accepting refugees from another 
covenant may cause friction with the 
existing covenfolk, and this may im-
pact their loyalty. The ﬁrst year af-
ter accepting refugees, the covenant 
suffers a Loyalty penalty of –3, as 
though suffering a Severe Hardship 
(see Covenants, Chapter 3, for more on 
governance in general and loyalty in 
particular). After that, each story that 
is told in which the two communities 
are brought closer together reduces 
this penalty by one. This means that 
tension within the covenfolk may im-
pact loyalty for far longer than the 
initial year.
But the situation could worsen, 
which could see the covenant riven 
with jealousy and resentment. The 
Divided Loyalty Major Residents 
Hook (Covenants, page 19) is appro-
priate for troupes wanting to high-
light these problems.
Character Creation
As a group of grogs now stripped 
of their covenant, any of the other ar-
chetypes can be applied, and all the 
reasons for wanting to live within the 
protection of a covenant still apply. 
The additional motivation is clear: to 
carry on living life in perhaps the only 
way they know.
Many understand the routines 
and needs of magi, others may have 
supernatural Virtues or Flaws that 
make them useful to magical schol-
ars, and some may have mundane 
connections within other covenants, 
and be able to bring information 
with them.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
Refugees can clearly be of any 
age and have a range of character-
istics. The example used here is for 
a Librarian already well-practiced in 
his profession.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Virtues and Flaws might include: 
Custos (granting Academic Abili-
ties), Magic Items*, Puissant Profes-
sion: Librarian; Stuck in his Ways*, 
Ability Block (Martial), Covenant 
Upbringing
* See Chapter 6: New Virtues and Flaws
The example refugee whom we’re 
following is a Librarian, a valued and 
trusted role, so the position of Cus-
tos is appropriate, as is Puissant Pro-
fession: Librarian. His service may 
also have awarded him an enchanted 
item, covered by the Magic Items 
Virtue. As for Flaws, coming to a new 
covenant may take some adjustment, 
so he has the new Stuck in his Ways 
Flaw. He is completed by a Martial 
Ability Block, due to years of doing 
little beyond his academia during his 
Covenant Upbringing.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Grogs coming from another cov-
enant are well trained and practiced 
in their given trades. The following 
abilities are typical of a specialist 
Librarian coming from a covenant 
background.
As his career progresses, he de-
velops other skills related to the texts 
he manages and maintains, including 
Profession: Calligraphy to help draft 
documents at the covenant’s behest, 
and Academic Abilities through 
years of studying the books that he 
cares for.
Importantly, as he spends longer 
at his new covenant, he learns more 
about the people, ways, and traditions 
of his new home.
New Spell: The Librarian’s Buckle
ReCo 25
Pen +0, 24/day
R: Touch, D: Concentration, 
T: Individual
This enchanted buckle allows 
the wearer to move with freedom 
in any direction, even unsupported 
into the air. It was designed for and 
awarded to the librarian of a now-
dissolved covenant and became a 
symbol of the ofﬁce, passed down 
through generations of librarians. 
That covenant had a library built 
in a tall narrow tower, with the 
most valuable books and scrolls 
stored in a chamber near the roof 
that was inaccessible without using 
the buckle.
(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Concen-
tration; +5 for 24 uses per day; +5 
levels to allow the device to main-
tain concentration)

Refugee Librarian Story Seeds
This particular option has enor-
mous potential for story. Covenfolk 
provide obvious witnesses to the 
events that befell a magus or a cov-
enant, and their testimony could 
be troublesome to the guilty. The 
knowledge they bring with them 
also provides seeds into numerous 
treasure-hunting opportunities, as 
new vis sources, auras, and regio-
nes are disclosed. And the prescient 
among the grogs may take such 
books and devices as they can before 
ﬁnally abandoning their home.
INFLUX
A handful of refugees arrives at 
the covenant offering service and 
asking to be taken in. They are the 
covenfolk of a nearby covenant, al-
most forgotten by the Order and 
home to an elderly magus and his 
loyal ﬁlia. The refugees tell how a 
magus arrived and killed their mas-
ters before claiming their tower, 
their village, and all within it. These 
covenfolk are the ones who ran. 
There are others still back at the 
covenant, forced to do their new 
master’s bidding. Is this violent ma-
gus a threat to the covenant? Who 
is he and under what grounds has he 
taken this small covenant? More im-
portantly from the refugees’ point of 
view, can they stay or will they be 
turned out?
AN UNNATURAL DIVIDE
Ever since the refugees arrived at 
the covenant all those years ago, the 
community has been on the brink of 
division. Over the years, the coven-
folk have split into those who live 
in the Upper Village and those who 
live in the Lower Village. And when 
a girl from the Upper Village is mur-
dered, the magi must ﬁnd the killer 
before revenge is taken against the 
Lower Villagers.
THE ENCROACHING WINTER
The dissolution of the covenant 
draws close. The signs are there; the 
covenant’s enemies are circling, no 
apprentices have been taken in years, 
and vis sites have fallen to nobles as 
they build their estates. The magi 
seem not to have noticed the grow-
ing weight of troubles, but there are 
those who have lived through this 
before, many years ago. Only they 
can rouse the magi from their com-
placency and make them learn the 
mistakes of a former generation, and 
only they can save the covenant.
A COVENANT WITH NO MAGUS
When the last magus of a winter 
covenant dies, the covenfolk agree 
to continue operating the covenant 
as though nothing has changed. The 
covenant, after all, has mundane 
sources of income, enough land be-
ing farmed to feed the covenfolk, 
and more. The books in the library 
describe where the vis sites are and 
how the vis can be harvested, so a 
faux trade in vis is started with the 
visiting Redcaps, and secretaries 
to the old dead magus maintain his 
correspondences. And so the great 
deception begins. But what happens 
when the Order ﬁnds out?

PERSONALITY TRAITS
Refugees who have been forced to 
leave a failed or destroyed covenant 
may retain a Loyal to Former Cov-
enant Personality Trait, which comes 
into play when dealing with connec-
tions to their former covenant, such as 
other covenfolk, magi, or apprentices. 
This loyalty may work against the 
character, as there may be a percep-
tion of bias which his new colleagues 
may resent.
Those who have been forced to 
leave through the actions of their 
former masters may instead have an 
Anger at Former Covenant Personal-
ity Trait. Again, this can be brought 
into play during stories concerning 
that covenant.
Other Personality Traits should 
be taken as appropriate for the in-
dividual. In the example here, the 
Librarian is Respectful and Keen to 
Impress, in addition to his Loyal to 
Former Covenant trait.
Refugee Librarian  
as Companion
Whatever cataclysm befell the 
former covenant, the same mindset 
applies to the former companions of 
those magi as to their grogs. Indeed, 
some of those companions may now 
be looked to for leadership. It may be 
one of those companions who leads 
the convoy of displaced grogs to their 
new covenant.
Companions, by their role in the 
saga, are those who are more likely to 
take important roles within the cov-
enant, including leadership roles. Addi-
tional Virtues and Flaws may be taken 
to reﬂect this, including Difﬁcult Un-
derlings, representing the resentment 
and distrust of the new interloper, or 
the trouble he faces trying to keep his 
old covenfolk under control. Compan-
ions may also know more about the fall 
of a previous covenant, and may even 
have played a greater role in that fall 
than they would care to admit, and so 
may take the Dark Secret Story Flaw.
The  
Role-Bound 
Ferryman
There’s only one way onto the island. And 
only the ferryman knows the way. But do not 
bother the ferryman lightly, for he sees what’s 
in your heart and it may not be to the island 
that he takes ye.
General Background
There are no records of the ferry-
man’s arrival, no records of his name, 
and nobody knows why he never 
leaves his ferry. He just silently stands. 
And silently waits. And silently does 
his job. The Role-bound Ferryman 


--- Page ---

129
Grogs
and grogs like him are characters who 
are not designed to grow over time. 
Instead, they are designed as mystic 
forces present in the covenant since 
before anyone can remember.
The deﬁnition of a role-bound 
grog is one who can serve no purpose 
other than the role he currently occu-
pies. A role-bound watchman cannot 
leave his post to accompany a magus 
on a long journey. Nor can he take 
messages far from the covenant at the 
behest of his captain or the steward.
For this reason, grogs like this tend 
to play ﬂeeting roles in stories, but 
they are open to all and may be played 
during stories closer to the covenant 
or involving their particular role.
ALTERNATIVES
These strange warped creatures, 
gone beyond human and now made 
something “other,” can be found per-
forming a number of roles, not just the 
role of ferryman.
While the characters suggested 
here do not have Magic Might, chap-
ter 4 of Realms of Power: Magic provides 
full rules on designing and creating 
Magic Human characters. Characters 
bound to a device or to their role can 
be considered some kind of halfway 
point between mortal or human and 
faerie or magically transformed.
Such characters are always too lim-
ited to be played as companions and 
so take the grog role within the saga.
Character Creation
There are a number of special con-
siderations in creating these characters.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
Role-bound characters can be of 
any age and there is story potential 
both in the younger and older age 
ranges. Younger characters may ex-
perience the event that binds them 
to their role during play, gaining the 
Flaw that deﬁnes them (see later) as 
a story event, while older characters 
may have been at the covenant for a 
long time with seemingly nobody now 
questioning their origin or purpose.
The Role-bound Ferryman dis-
cussed in this section has a poor 
Communication, probably through 
years of near solitude, but high Stam-
ina from his long service out on the 
marsh in all weather. Others unfortu-
nate enough to be bound to their role 
may have higher Dexterity, as beﬁts a 
dedicated craftsman.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
The ferryman is bound to his role, 
unable to change beyond its conﬁnes. 
But though he is deﬁned by his role, 
he has other gifts. His unearthly de-
meanor is represented by the Piercing 
Gaze Virtue, but his true gifts are the 
Premonitions of harm that threaten 
the covenant, and his Second Sight 
with which he scans the horizon look-
ing for ghostly visitations. His chief 
Flaw is Bound to Ferryman Role and 
because few know of or understand 
this supernatural curse, he is also 
Judged Unfairly. Perhaps through the 
same effect, he has lost much of his 
ability to communicate, represented 
by the Poor Communication Flaw. 
This gives the ferryman the fol-
lowing Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; 
Piercing Gaze, Premonitions, Second 
Sight; Bound to (Ferryman) Role*, 
Judged Unfairly, Poor Communication
* See Chapter 6: New Virtues and Flaws
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
The usual rules regarding limits on 
starting Ability scores and childhood 
experience apply to these characters, 
just as for other grogs. In addition, 
role-bound grogs must have a Profes-
sion or Craft Ability that deﬁnes them. 
Martial or other abilities may be sub-
stituted with the troupe’s agreement.
TRAINING PACKAGES
The ferryman most likely has had 
an athletic childhood spent out on the 
marshes, so this package is used as the 
base. Abilities are then bought to suit 
the character. Once play starts, the 
Role-bound Ferryman uses the follow-
ing Training Packages with alterations 
based on his situation and Abilities:

Excess experience points that do not 
reach a higher Ability score have been 
redistributed in the sample Abilities ear-
lier to ensure that all have been spent 
with no remainders. In addition, the 
ferryman has acquired an enriched Item 
of Virtue by his 65th year, granted by 
virtue of the Magician training package.
PERSONALITY TRAITS
Unless affected by other effects, 
characters bound to their role possess 
and express Personality Traits just as 
other grogs, but years of being re-
stricted to one role, often unable to 
live a normal natural life, may take its 
toll on their personality. They may be 
resentful or resigned, bitter or accept-
ing, searching for release or loyal to 
their covenant.
The Role-bound Ferryman dis-
cussed earlier has the following Per-
sonality Traits: Loyal to the Covenant 
+3, Taciturn +2, Reliable +1
The  
Street Thug

what people like me do down here. But that 
don’t mean they don’t know where to ﬁnd us 
when they want something done.
There are times when the educated 
and the wealthy must give way to the 
unsophisticated and down-at-heel. In 
those times, the covenant would do 
well to have contacts with the under-
class found in every town and city.
General Background
Crime is an inescapable part of 
life, especially in the towns and cities 
of Mythic Europe. Several covenants 
Role-Bound Ferryman Story Seeds
In many ways, the Role-Bound 
grog is a story seed.
A DANGER TO THE COVENANT
A man has gone missing. He was 
last seen trying to reach the cov-
enant, asking the ferryman for pas-
sage, but he never arrived. The cov-
enant has always taken the ferryman 
for granted, never asking who he is 
or why he does what he does. But 
what has the ferryman done with 
the man and why?
THE EXPERIMENT
The covenant awakes one morn-
ing to ﬁnd something unheard of in 
living memory: the ferryman is not 
at his post. Not only that, but his 
boat is gone too. A magus of House 
Verditius, who visited the covenant 
some seasons before, has stolen the 
ferryman away. He recognized that 
the ferryman is bound to his role, 
and bound to his boat. The magus 
has taken him in order to experi-
ment upon him, to ﬁnd the secret 
of binding devices to the living, or 
binding a living mind into a device. 
Can the covenant ﬁnd their man be-
fore the Verditius experiments tear 
him from his boat?
WHAT SORROWS HAVE  
BOUND THIS MAN?
Nobody has ever asked what 
binds the ferryman to his ferry, not 
really. Magi have wondered what 
magical force sustains him in all 
weathers, unchanging and unﬂinch-
ing. But nobody has ever wondered 
at the tragedy that turned him into 
the creature he is. Until now. An old 
text, written by a monk describing 
his journey through the region, has 
been found in a nearby church that 
tells of a man whose wife became 
lost and disappeared out on the 
marsh. The text describes how he 
waits for her to return. The text was 
written centuries ago, but the man 
it describes seems to be the ferry-
man. Do the magi search the text for 
clues? Do they ﬁnd the ferryman’s 
wife and set him free from his curse?

Grogs
across the Order, especially those in 
Tribunals where city life is fast becom-
ing more common, have explicit con-
nections with street gangs. In some 
cases, the connections run far deeper 
than the covenant would ever publicly 
admit to.
Street gangs have several things 
to offer a covenant keen to maintain 
a presence within a city. Firstly, the 
gang, through its extended network 
of social contacts, can be an effective 
intelligence network. Information on 
the movement of speciﬁc targets can 
be tracked and fed back to the cov-
enant; the mood of the city can be 
felt in the markets, taverns, and docks; 
and violence can be bought as easily as 
bread. The deeper the covenant goes 
with one or more street gangs, the 
more these can be used. Ultimately, 
the activities of a criminal network 
can be used as a source of income as 
described in Covenants, page 59.
But covenants wanting to use a 
street gang will need a man on the 
inside. A contact. A Street Thug. The 
Street Thug is any member of the 
street gang with the sense to see the 
magi as an opportunity. He may be a 
lowly petty criminal, or someone with 
brains enough to be running the out-
ﬁt. He will know the streets of his city 
and have social contacts all over. He’s 
not a thief in the manner of a cutpurse, 
conﬁdence trickster, or palmist. He’s a 
thug. He’ll demand protection money 
in exchange for not burning down 
your workshop. He’ll work the girls 
along the waterfront. He’ll stab you 
in the legs and rob you while you’re 
bleeding. There’s nothing dashing or 
benign about him and he’ll probably 
hang one day.
He is best suited to stories set with-
in the town or city and can be used as 
an effective bodyguard, lookout, thief, 
or agitator. If the magi need a diver-
sion to be created in the city, he’s the 
man to go to. And if they need some-
one roughed up a little, they need 
look no further.
The Street Thug probably doesn’t 
live at the covenant, even if that cov-
enant is based within the city walls. In 
fact, when the Street Thug does spend 
time at the covenant, he probably 
causes disruption and upset. But he’s a 
frequent visitor, coming to the kitch-
ens to eat at his paymasters’ expense; 
badgering their steward for new boots, 
cloak, or unspeciﬁed expenses; or just 
to hide out while the heat is on.
Character Creation
The following notes provide some 
suggestions for creating Street Thugs.
AGE AND CHARACTERISTICS
The Street Thug is really designed 
to either live fast and be hanged 
young, or to be a little more cagey 
and survive to run the joint. As well 
as making Aging Rolls for the Street 
Thug, storyguides may also want to 
decide whether the Street Thug has 
been caught in the act of committing 
a crime or targeted by his enemies, 
and whether there is a need for action 
from the magi to save him.
Regardless of this, life on the 
streets takes a heavy toll. The Poor 
Living Conditions Flaw (see Chapter 
6, New Virtues and Flaws), on top of 
the base –2 Living Conditions Modi-
ﬁer for living in a town, means that 
the Street Thug can expect to have a 
Decrepitude Score of 2 and Charac-
teristics totaling –5, rather than the 
starting 7, by the age of 50. An aging 
Crisis is only a few years away, most 
likely a Minor Illness as per the Crisis 
Table on ArM5, page 170.
SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Grogs can’t take the Outlaw Lead-
er Minor Social Status Flaw, but as a 
petty criminal, the Branded Criminal 
Social Status Flaw is appropriate for 
the Street Thug character. It sets him 
out as recognizably unsavory, and 
gives him access to Martial Abilities 
from the outset. However, the Street 
Thug is a brawler used to bludgeoning 
his opponents with whatever comes 
to hand amid the ﬁlth of the alleyway. 
Years of violence have toughened him 
up, hence the Tough Virtue to provide 
that extra Soak bonus. The last Virtue 
is Social Contacts, representing the 
contacts he’s made on both sides of 
law and order across the city.
The Street Thug has two Flaws left 
to take, and both of these are new to 
this supplement. The Fish Out of Wa-
ter (Cities) Flaw shows how little of life 
outside the city the Street Thug has 
experienced, and how uncomfortable 
he feels without familiar surroundings. 
But despite being at home in the City, 
he has particularly Poor Living Con-
ditions. This last Flaw comes mainly 
from the daily grind of petty violence 
that takes its toll on him.
The following Virtues and Flaws 
represent a typical Street Thug: Brand-
ed Criminal; Puissant Brawl, Social 
Contacts (street criminals), Tough; 
Fish Out of Water (Cities)*, Poor Liv-
ing Conditions*
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws
Puissant Brawl and Tough can eas-
ily be exchanged for other Minor Vir-
tues, such as Berserk for a more overtly 
dangerous ﬁghter, and Large or Endur-
ing Constitution.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
The Street Thug seeks experience 
in anything that helps him get through 
another day on the street. This is likely 
to be Brawl, Guile, Area Lore, and for 
intimidation, Leadership. Brawl is the 
Street Thug’s combat Ability of choice 
as people in cities are rarely armed and 
even more rarely armored. He is also

Grogs
backed up by a gang and will almost 
always be in a trained combat group 
when with his own people. When not 
using his ﬁsts, a bludgeon, or a knife, 
he prefers a hatchet for its small size 
and brutal simplicity.
As the Street Thug grows older, he 
gains more authority over his gang, 
learning more about its activities and 
members, represented by his growing 
Leadership and Gang Lore Abilities.
TRAINING PACKAGES
Training packages for Street Thugs 
include: Brawler, Footpad*, Leader, 
Local, Soldier, Wastrel.
* The experience points against Leg-
erdemain in this package are 
more likely spent against Thrown 
Weapon

PERSONALITY TRAITS  
& REPUTATION
The Street Thug has three Person-
ality Traits. Rather than having true 
bravery, the Street Thug is Aggres-
sive, an important distinction. And he 
is also Ruthless, prepared to commit 
crime, to hurt and harm others, and 
to betray those in his way. He’ll very 
rarely ﬁnd himself as the vanguard in 
any combat group; while he’s aggres-
sive enough to start the ﬁght, he’s also 
ruthless enough to make sure other 
people get hurt ﬁrst.
But ultimately, the Street Thug is 
Pragmatic. This pragmatism is what 
draws the Street Thug to the magi and 
their covenant, and it is this pragma-
tism that stands in place of loyalty; he 
Street Thug Story Seeds
The story seeds that follow use 
the city streets as a backdrop, and 
the Street Thug himself either as 
part of the lead-in or as a tool to be 
used in the in the story resolution.
BLOOD ON THE STREETS
The streets are running with 
blood, the city watch just look the 
other way, and someone at the top 
is getting very rich. They say that 
there’s magic at work and that’s why 
nobody can touch these people. 
Well, magic you have. Now all you 
need is someone who knows the 
streets and can ﬁnd out where the 
money’s going. Then it can start 
coming to you.
THE DEVIL MAKES  
WORK FOR IDLE HANDS
The Street Thug has a price on 
his head and is forced to lie low 
while the tempers cool and memo-
ries fade. The trouble is, he’s hiding 
out in the covenant. It doesn’t take 
long for his presence to become 
disruptive. The magi need to ﬁnd 
a job for him to do. It’s either that 
or turn him into a tree for the next 
month. But as it happens, the magi 
have heard that a tax collector of ill 
repute is arriving in town in the next 
week, and the taxes he’s collected 
will be stored in the sheriff’s keep. 
There might be a way to keep the 
Street Thug occupied and make a 
little money after all.
THE TAKEOVER
The magi receive an interest-
ing offer from the leader of a group 
of street thugs. He knows that the 
magi provide a little backup to his 
rival gang leader, but he can cut 
them in for bigger stakes if they’ll 
support him over their current asso-
ciates. But this new face is harboring 
an Infernal secret, and the offer is a 
temptation to betrayal. The wheels 
are already in motion. Can the magi 
root out the demons before they 
take hold in the city, and can they 
stop the violence before it spins out 
of control?

Grogs
can overlook their oddness if there’s 
money to be made and protection to 
be gained.
An older Street Thug may have 
gained a reputation before being 
brought into the game, most likely 
among his underworld associates. This 
reputation might reﬂect a ruthless 
streak, or a the strength with which he 
runs his gang or holds his turf. If cre-
ating an older character from scratch, 
you might want to swap out one of his 
ﬂaws for Infamous, which would give a 
bad reputation with a score of 4.
Street Thug  
as Companion
The obvious Social Status for a 
companion made in this mold is the 
Outlaw Leader. This gives the com-
panion a handful of loyal men to carry 
out jobs at his behest. As a result, a 
gang leader may well be Wealthy, as 
this represents the time he has avail-
able with his crew running operations 
on his behalf.
Street Thugs elevated to compan-
ion status have scope for Story Flaws, 
such as Enemies in the form of rival 
gangs (although Feud could easily be 
used for the same). For a different feel, 
the Difﬁcult Underlings Story Flaw is 
also appropriate as running a gang of 
troublemakers is guaranteed to attract 
even more trouble.
There’s also room to re-purpose 
the Minor General Temporal Inﬂu-
ence Virtue. The intent of the Virtue 
is to give a character political inﬂu-
ence through politically powerful 
connections. The same can be ap-
plied to the Outlaw Leader, though 
the nature of the connections is less 
socially acceptable.
There are a number of Story Flaws 
that are very useful to the Outlaw 
Leader character. Blackmail (as per the 
Story Flaw) is likely to be very com-
mon and will be used to great lever-
age. The ﬂip side is that you may owe 
Favors to others for their help, either 
in gathering information, watching 
your back, or for releasing men they 
had every reason to hang.
While the Street Thug as grog is 
useful for his aggressive approach and 
knowledge of the streets, the Outlaw 
Leader, as leader of a criminal street 
gang, is able to draw upon more re-
sources that the covenant could put to 
good use.
Time-Lost 
Witnesses
“…” 
Many medieval tales speak of 
people whisked away by the faeries, 
who dance for a few hours, and re-
turn to ﬁnd that each hour in Faerie 
was a year, or a century. Many of these 
misplaced people perish; they break a 
taboo placed upon them as they leave 
faerie, and they are crushed as a life-
time of aging pours over them in an 
instant. Some discover that they have 
died and faded to dust in Faerie, be-
coming faeries themselves without 
noticing. Some begin their mortal 
lives anew, centuries after all that they 
know has fallen into ruin.
General Background
Time-lost characters allow play-
ers to add anachronistic touches to 
their version of Mythic Europe. The 
time-lost characters described here are 
grogs, but companions are also easily 
accommodated in many sagas. Time-
lost magi are more difﬁcult to design. 
The Order of Hermes is a research-
based institution, and there is no way 
to consistently model how its many 
breakthroughs have contributed to 


--- Page ---

134
Grogs
the Art and spell levels in the standard 
setting. This means there is no way to 
handicap magi accurately for failing to 
share those breakthroughs.
Faeries may steal characters from 
any location, and from any histori-
cal era. People who witness momen-
tous events are more likely to be sto-
len away, then returned, than others. 
House Merinita suggests that this is 
because such events enter human folk-
lore and resound down the centuries. 
Time-lost characters face many ini-
tial difﬁculties. They often have poor 
language skills, which may prevent 
them seeking aid in mundane commu-
nities. Their Abilities may not suit the 
local economy, which may make it dif-
ﬁcult to ﬁnd work. They are unlikely 
to understand what has occurred, and 
may spend time on fruitless attempts 
to return home. Service to a covenant 
gives a time-lost character a chance to 
reorientate and learn local languages.
Magi interested in history desire 
time-lost people as covenfolk. Those 
who do not care for history know that 
many of their sodales do, and are will-
ing to pay handsomely in vis and po-
litical favors for eyewitnesses to inter-
esting historical events. Magi can read 
the memories of these events and, us-
ing the correct spells, feel everything 
that the eyewitness felt, which is as 
close as possible to being there. On 
a less aesthetic level, Seekers can sift 
the memories of witnesses for clues to 
the location of magical devices and 
sacred sites.
Character Creation
These notes will help you create a 
Time-lost Witness character.
Time-Lost Witnesses Story Seeds
The following story seeds use 
people from particular places and 
times, but can be easily adapted to 
refuges from other fallen civiliza-
tions or historical eras.
THE MADWOMAN  
WITH THE PAPYRUS
A churchman contacts a redcap 
whom he knows collects rare books. 
On being invested in his ofﬁce, the 
churchman took a tour of the facili-
ties in his care. One is a home for 
demoniacs — people afﬂicted in the 
mind by the forces of evil. Within 
this refuge, he found a woman who 
speaks only gibberish, but seems lu-
cid. The curate for the facility told 
the churchman that the demoniac 
was found wandering the roads, and 
had in her possession a curious scroll, 
ﬁlled with strange pictures.
Characters who investigate the 
scroll discover that it is made of plant 
ﬁber, but is not paper. This is highly 
unusual. It contains a series of pic-
tures, but by their repetition, these 
seem to form a code. Characters fa-
miliar with the works of Herodotus 
(Intelligence + Artes Liberales against 
an Ease Factor of 15) may recall that 
the ancient Egyptians wrote like this.
Characters who use magic to 
speak with the demoniac discover 
that her name is Sacmis, and she was 
a copyist at the Great Library of Al-
exandria. When part of it caught ﬁre, 
as the Romans invaded the city, she 
was whisked away by a ﬂying crea-
ture, and deposited on the roads in 
this chilly, savage country. 
Sacmis is interesting to the player 
characters for several reasons. Magi 
engrossed by history would love to in-
terview her. Seekers would like her aid 
to determine the locations of the great 
libraries of the ancient world, and as a 
translator for the text of the ancients. 
A handful of the spells held by House 
Bonisagus are from the period, but 
how the verbal components are in-
canted is not clear. Members of House 
Merinita value her scroll, because it 
contains the ﬁnal copy of many an-
cient stories about magicians. One of 
these is the “Tale of the Shipwrecked 
Sailor,” which is the origin myth of the 
sorcerers of the island of Soqotra.
AN ACCIDENTAL INVASION
Alarming reports have reached 
the town of an army that has forti-
ﬁed a mountain pass slightly to the 
northwest. The invaders have made 
no demands, and beyond levying a 
toll on passing merchants, they ap-
pear to be doing little. Noblemen 
and magi skilled in military matters 
are likely to guess, correctly, that 
the invaders have formed a defen-
sive position, and are sending scouts 
into the nearby territory. This force 
is acting like the beach-head for an 
invader, and so the region prepares 
for war.
Characters who question the 
merchants who have paid a toll to 
pass the encamped army can gath-
er some intelligence. The tax is in 
goods, and is requested from the 
merchants by a priest who speaks 
the local language. The priest says 
he is a captive of the invaders. The 
invaders speak Latin among them-
selves. Their camp is a wooden 
stockade with ditches around it. 
It has been laid out geometrically, 
like something from an ancient 
strategy manual. 
Magi may immediately assume 
this is a Hermetic plot. Only mem-
bers of the Order have sufﬁcient 
interest in the ancient empire to 
recreate a section of its military. 
The disruption this is causing is

SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Time-lost characters can come 
from any era, and so can have a wide 
variety of Abilities, Virtues, and Flaws. 
As examples, this section uses Ro-
man legionaries lost in a faerie wood, 
who re-emerge in 1220. These grogs 
require the Warrior Virtue, and must 
take the Worthless Abilities Flaw.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
Time-lost Witnesses may come 
from any background, and therefore 
may have any Ability. They are usu-
ally selected for abduction and return 
because their memories or skills will 
create interesting stories, so unusual 
skill sets are common among these 
characters.
TRAINING PACKAGES
Time-lost characters may come 
from any social group, and so their 
careers following their return may fol-
low any path.
SAMPLE ABILITY SCORES
Using Roman legionaries as exam-
ples, this set of Abilities requires the

enough to make it a High Crime. 
The magi might instead assume this 
is an elaborate faerie game, since 
a signiﬁcant occasion has recently 
passed. In truth, the signiﬁcant day 
weakened the barriers between Fa-
erie and the real world, allowing 
this group to escape.
The Roman commander, notic-
ing a sudden change in landforms, 
has encamped his eighty men in a 
well-defended position where they 
can get water from a stream. They 
have some supplies, which are ex-
tended by foraging and taxing pass-
ing traders. He is sending out scouts 
to get the lay of the land. Following 
this, he is going to march toward 
the largest city, to re-establish his 
connection with the army’s com-
mand structure. This will be met, 
by the confused locals, as if it were 
an invasion.
Player characters can most easily 
intervene in this scenario by captur-
ing and then negotiating with one of 
the Roman scouts. The Roman com-
mander, if convinced the empire is 
gone, may wish to use his force to 
conquer a signiﬁcant town, to sup-
ply his army and act as the kernel 
of a new empire. He may seek out 
the Emperor of Nicaea, to offer the 
swords of his men to the leader of 
the modern Romans. He may accept 
the Order as the heir to the legacy of 
Rome, and enter service.
CONFUSED FAERIES
Faeries love games involving so-
cial roles. The return of a character 
central to a great tragedy can allow 
them to play interesting games. 
In 1120, William Adelin, the only 
legitimate son of Henry I of Eng-
land, vanished during a shipwreck. 
He was considered dead and, after 
his death, the realm fell into anar-
chy as his cousin and sister fought 
for dominance. Following this tur-
bulence, a line of sacramentally-
crowned kings continued until the 
incumbent king.
Henry III has not been crowned 
king of England in the correct way. 
His father lost the Crown Jewels 
during his wars with the nobility. At 
his father’s death, Henry was hastily 
crowned with a piece of his mother’s 
jewelry, by the Bishop of Gloucester. 
The Archbishop of Canterbury, who 
has the right and duty to crown the 
king, was supporting Louis of France, 
who had invaded England and held 
London. Even the Pope says that 
Henry has not been crowned prop-
erly — there is no King of England, 
in a mystical sense.
This makes William Adelin the 
perfect pawn in a rags-to-riches sto-
ry, but few faeries have the power to 
make kings anymore. What happens 
instead is that many faerie princes 
treat him as if he were King of Eng-
land. They send him weird gifts, and 
they ask for strange treaties. The 
magi who control access to William 
have many opportunities for proﬁt, 
but must act carefully: every gift 
must be matched with a gift of equal 
value, from the distorted perspective 
of the faerie that sent it, and every 
agreement made must be upheld, in 
some contorted way.
William’s shipload of servants 
and warriors has difﬁculty interact-
ing with the modern world. They 
speak a variant of French which is 
understandable, if accented. They 
are an older sort of Norman, ruth-
less Christianized Vikings, whose 
society is built around territorial 
expansion and plunder. Their soci-
ety can’t ﬁnd victims in the rapidly 
urbanizing, heavily armed states of 
the 13th century.

Time-lost Witness  
as Companion
Time-lost characters have been 
personally selected by faeries to be 
removed from time, then released, at 
a particular moment and in a particu-
lar place, to cause interesting stories 
to be told. They have, therefore, an 
unusual range of Virtues, and these 
may suit the covenant’s needs in a 
particular saga with an eerie exact-
ness. Time-lost characters may suffer 
a Delusion that they can return to 
their own time.
Horses  
& Hounds
Woof.
Virtually every covenant has ani-
mal as well as human inhabitants, and 
sometimes these animals have a large 
enough impact on a saga to become 
grog characters. It is not suggested 
that every chicken, plow-ox, and 
farmyard rat should have a character 
sheet; however, some characters may 
have Animal Companions or exotic 
pets, and it might be interesting for 
these animals to become player char-
acters run by the same player, or by a 
different one.
Horses and hounds are common 
examples of animals that are suitable 
as player characters, but any animal is 
theoretically possible. As a guideline, 
creatures between the Sizes of –3 and 
+2 (from cat-sized to horse-sized) 
probably make the best animal grogs, 
but these shouldn’t be seen as hard 
limits. Lords of Men (Chapter 5) has 
details of a number of animals that are 
found in noble households, from pets

eval bestiaries divide animals up into

Grogs
ﬁsh, serpents (including lizards), and 
vermin (insects, spiders, mice, and so 
forth); only the latter are not suitable 
as animal grogs due to their small 
size. See Art & Academe, page 29, for a 
longer discussion on animals in Me-
dieval Europe.
Disadvantages Inherent 
in Playing an Animal
There are several inherent prob-
lems with playing an animal grog 
that are not represented by Virtues 
and Flaws. This places the animal 
grog at a distinct disadvantage com-
pared to human characters, which is 
only offset by the novelty of playing 
an animal rather than a human.
PHYSICAL FORM
Most animals lack grasping hands, 
and even those that have them (such 
as monkeys and birds) lack the ﬁne 
control and opposable thumbs of 
humans. This bars them from many 
simple tasks, and precludes the use of 
weapons or tools.
There are some advantages to 
having an animal’s body. Most have 
a covering of fur, feathers, or scales, 
which grant an intrinsic Protection 
of at least 1. Further, animals usually 
possess at least one natural weapon 
such as claws, teeth, or horns. Some 
animals can ﬂy or breathe water, and 
require no special Virtue to possess 
these abilities. For a list of the quali-
ties that an animal’s physical form 
can have, see the supplement Houses 
of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 40. If us-
ing the system of mundane Qualities 
to describe the intrinsic features of 
animal forms, do not apply any listed 
modiﬁers to Characteristics or Abili-
ties; instead use the system described 
later in this section.
CUNNING RATHER  
THAN INTELLIGENCE
Animals do not have Intelligence, 
and are therefore bereft of the ability 
to reason. They are incapable of logi-
cal thought, or of drawing conclusions 
from evidence. For example, a dog that 
sees a hare dash into a thicket either 
chases in after it, or waits at the point 
its quarry entered the bush. It does not 
think to go around to the other side of 
the bush to the point where the hare 
might leave.
The Cunning characteristic pos-
sessed by beasts means that they 
act largely through estimation (also 
called instinct), and are ruled by their 
Personality Traits. However, they 
still possess the other components of 
a mind — cognition, common sense, 
memory, and imagination. See Art & 
Academe, page 31, for more details on 
these inner wits. However, animals 
are severely limited by their compara-
tive difﬁculty in learning new things; 
this is represented by the Restricted 
Learning Flaw (see Chapter 6, New 
Virtues and Flaws), which all animal 
grogs must take.
LACK OF LANGUAGE ABILITIES
Animal characters cannot speak, 
but they can understand any lan-
guages they know. However, unlike 
human characters, they do not receive 
an automatic Native Language Abil-
ity. When earning experience points 
in a human Language, an animal al-
ways has a Source Quality of (4 + 
Cunning), meaning that they tend to 
learn more slowly than humans. Fur-
thermore, if an animal has a negative 
Cunning score, it must reduce any 
human Language Score by a similar 
amount, to a minimum of 0. Thus a 
creature with Cunning –1 that knows 
French 1 can only understand a hand-
ful of words at most. Creatures with a 
positive Cunning receive no bonus to 
understanding language.
Horses & Hounds Story Seeds
Animals get involved in stories 
without realizing it, but can have a 
signiﬁcant impact on events.
A CALM-TEMPERED ROUNCEY
A magus at the covenant is a 
great traveler, and he has heard of a 
distant covenant that breeds horses 
that are immune to the effects of 
The Gift. The player characters set 
out to acquire such a beast, and per-
haps negotiate the purchase of more 
than one. Naturally, the breeder of 
these horses sets a high price for 
them — more than the characters 
were prepared for — but he sug-
gests a way in which they could 
earn a discount. Every year, he must 
round up the magical stallion that is 
the sire of his foals; if they assist him 
with this difﬁcult task, then he will 
reduce his normal price for one of 
his three-year-old mares.
THE ANIMAL COLLECTOR
A covenant that has an exotic 
animal among its grogs comes to the 
notice of one of the king’s agents. 
He is collecting animals on the 
king’s behalf for a menagerie, and 
seeks to acquire the creature owned 
by the characters. If the magi want 
to hang on to their grog, they must 
ﬁnd some way to dissuade the king’s 
man without directly interfering 
with mundane politics. Certainly, 
if the man does not return from his 
mission, the king will send further 
agents accompanied by armed men 
to discover what has happened.

Grogs
In Mythic Europe, animals are nat-
urally capable of communicating with 
members of their own kind, and with 
closely-related kinds, so dogs have a 
Language Ability called Dog, horses 
speak Horse, and so forth. This Lan-
guage Ability allows an animal grog 
to communicate simple concepts only, 
as if they had a Language Score of 2 
(ArM5, page 66). They can talk to re-
lated species as if their Language Abil-
ity was one point lower, so a wolf, for 
example, can understand a few words 
of Dog. This Language Ability cannot 
be increased with experience.
AGING RATE
“...a hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs 
and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, 
enormous whales, the world: each one follow-
ing triples the years of the one before.”
— Inlay around the pavement in 
           Westminster Abbey, 13th century
Animals age at different rates to 
humans; most clawed and hoofed 
beasts have a shorter lifespan than hu-
mans, whereas birds and ﬁsh in Myth-
ic Europe live about the same time or 
longer than humans. There are three 
things to be considered: the age at 
which aging begins, the adjustment to 
the aging roll due to age, and the num-
ber of aging rolls per year. A human, 
with an average lifespan of 50 years 
(ignoring lifestyle modiﬁers), begins 
aging at 35, adds 1 to the aging roll 
for every 10 years, and makes 1 aging 
roll each year. The storyguide should 
decide upon the average lifespan of 
the creature and adjust these ﬁgures 
accordingly. Thus, a creature with 
an average lifespan of 10 years has a 
modiﬁer of (50/10), or 5. It therefore 
begins aging at (35/5) 7 years old, adds 
one to the aging roll for every (10/5) 2 
years of age, and makes (1 x 5) 5 aging 
rolls each year. If more than one ag-
ing roll is made each year, they should 
be spread evenly throughout the four 
seasons, with any excess occurring in 
Winter. Some example aging charac-
teristics are given in the nearby table.
General Background
A grog character that is a domes-
tic animal is easy to integrate into any 
saga — horses, dogs, hawks, and other 
animals that frequently associate with 
mankind can be purchased from breed-
ers by any character or covenant that 
desires them. Integrating wild animals 
can be similarly easy, depending on 
the species involved; a bear could have 
been found as a cub and trained as an 
entertainer, or a character with the An-
imal Ken Virtue might befriend a raven 
and keep it as a pet. A trained animal is 
capable of performing certain tasks — 
even complex tasks — at the command 
of its master, and you should be clear 
what commands you know and can 
complete without the barrier of lan-
guage between you and your master. 
Rules for training animals are given in 
Art & Academe (page 119), and summa-
rized under the Animal Trainer, earlier.
Playing a character without an 
intellect can pose a signiﬁcant chal-
lenge. As a starting point, play 
careful attention to the human Lan-
guage score of the grog (modiﬁed 
by Cunning, as mentioned earlier). 
If she lacks a Language score, or has 
a modiﬁed score of 0, then she can 
only understand direct commands 
in which she has been trained. Feel 
free to stare blankly at other play-
ers if they try to communicate with 
you beyond your understanding. As 
a creature ruled by instinct, an animal 
grog should act in accordance with 
her Personality Traits and Flaws as 
much as possible. They should domi-
nate every judgment or decision the 
character makes; lacking free will, an 
animal feels neither restraint nor guilt 
over the actions it takes.
Character Creation
Character creation of an animal 
grog is different in several respects 
from that of human characters. The 
reader is directed to Houses of Hermes: 
Mystery Cults, pages 38–43, for more 
information on this.
CHARACTERISTICS AND SIZE
An animal grog has the Size of 
her animal form, which is normally 
a creature between Size –3 and Size 
+2. The Large Virtue or Small Frame 
Flaw can make the character an usu-
ally large or small specimen of her 
kind, and adjusts the normal Size of 
the creature by one point in the ap-
plicable direction.
Animal characters receive the same 
number of points to spend on Char-
acteristics as humans. However, when 
dealing with human characters, rather 
than characters of their own species, 
they take penalties to Presence and 
Communication according to the fol-
lowing table:

SUGGESTED VIRTUES AND FLAWS
Animal grogs suffer from the ef-
fects of the No Hands and Mute Flaws, 
but these are intrinsic to the character 
concept, and do not count toward the 
character’s normal allotment of Flaws, 
nor do they provide points with which 
to buy Virtues.
Animal grogs are required to take 
the Restricted Learning* Flaw. They 
generally have the Domestic Animal, 
Wanderer, or Companion Animal 
Social Status Virtues or Flaws. Other 
suitable Virtues and Flaws include:
Virtues: Berserk, Domestic Animal*, 
Enduring Constitution, Ferocity*, 
Improved Characteristics, Light-
ning Reﬂexes, Long-Winded, Pack 
Leader*, Perfect Balance, Rapid 
Convalescence, Piercing Gaze, Re-
serves of Strength, Self-Conﬁdent, 
Tough, Wilderness Sense
Flaws: Clumsy, Companion Ani-
mal*, Fragile Constitution, Fear, 
Noncombatant, Nocturnal, Pack 
Mentality*, Poor Eyesight, Poor 
Hearing, Poor Living Conditions*, 
Reckless, Reclusive, Weakness; 
most Major Personality Flaws tak-
en as Minor Flaws.
* See Chapter 6, New Virtues and Flaws.
Animal grogs cannot take Virtues 
and Flaws that involve interaction 
with human society. An animal grog 
with the Animal Ken Virtue can use 
it to communicate with unrelated 
animal species, and, at the option of 
the troupe, with humans as well. This 
Supernatural Ability substitutes for 
a Language Ability, but can never be 
higher than the creature’s native ani-
mal Language Ability.
SUGGESTED ABILITIES
An animal grog receives 120 expe-
rience points for his pre-adult life; this 
leaves him at the starting age shown 
in the table earlier (under Aging). The 
character also receives a single Animal 
Language at a score of 2. This implies 
that some infant animals are particu-
larly fast learners, which is true; by the 
time they reach adulthood, they have 
a fair complement of Abilities. Note 
that birds need no Ability to be able to 
ﬂy, but could beneﬁt from Athletics to 
perform unusual maneuvers. Likewise, 
all ﬁsh can swim, but may need to roll 
on their Swim Ability to escape preda-
tors or chase prey. 
An animal grog subsequently gains 
the usual number of experience points 
per year (usually 15) beyond their 
starting age. However, an animal usu-
ally has to make Aging Rolls much 
earlier than a human, so players may 
wish to take care in applying too many 
additional years to an animal grog. 
The storyguide might want to restrict 
the maximum Ability scores of an ani-
mal grog based on his age, much like 
human characters are limited (ArM5, 
page 31).
Animal grogs typically possess 
the following Abilities: Area Lore, 
Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Hunt, 
Leadership (for pack or herd leaders), 
Music (for songbirds), Stealth, Sur-
vival, Swim.
TRAINING PACKAGES
Training packages are inapplicable 
for animal grogs, because of their re-
stricted Ability sets.

DOG, 1 YEAR OLD: Athletics 3 (chas-
ing), Awareness 3 (scent), Brawl 3

Animals as Companions
An animal grog could easily be-
come a companion by being trans-
formed by powerful supernatural 
effects. As a result of warping, the 
creature could become infused with 
powers of its own, or else become 
corrupted by some hellish power. 
The most extreme form of this sort 
of transformation entails gaining a 
Might Score. The four Realms of Power 
sourcebooks include details for cre-
ating creatures that are either aligned 
to or are members of a given super-
natural Realm.
Brief Grog 
Concepts

Grogs
The Accursed
Some live within a covenant as 
it offers a way of life that can’t be 
found elsewhere. But others have little 
choice but to seek out magical aid.
The Accursed is afﬂicted with a 
Supernatural Flaw, such as Lesser 
Malediction or (Realm) Stigmata*, 
and the covenant is the only place 
where The Accursed feels safe. Ei-
ther protected by the Aegis of the 
Hearth or held in check by the magic 
of the scholars he serves, The Ac-
cursed enjoys relief from his curse, 
until his masters have need of it. 
Other than this, the Accursed could 
have any complement of Abilities, 
Virtues, or Flaws.
TRAINING PACKAGES: any
The Barbarian
Hermetic magi do travel a lot, 
and often they will visit remote areas 
in the farthest corners of Mythic Eu-
rope. Local guides or professionals 
may be hired on such journeys, and 
a bond may form or some beneﬁcial 
agreement be made. These locals may 
choose to join the turb and accompa-
ny the magi home. Eastern or north-
ern Europe should provide sufﬁcient 
cultural differences from a saga set in 
Britain, France, or the Italian peninsula.
Once back at the covenant, these 
Barbarians often have a hard time 
adapting to the language, society, 
and even climate. They wear funny 
clothes, use odd weapons and tools, 
and in general do things differently — 
they might even be pagan.
Social Status like Outsider may 
apply, although it need not be a stig-
ma. Foreign Upbringing* and Primi-
tive Equipment* may be appropriate. 
His native language is one foreign 
to the local area of the setting, and 
he needs to learn a second language. 
Area Lore in his native area is a more 
likely Ability than the covenant’s 
locale. Barbarians often have good 
scores in Survival and Ride, and prob-
ably have an Organization Lore that 
matches their home culture.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Archer, Brawl-
er, Rider, Soldier, Woodsman
The Coastal Raider
A pirate, Berber, or Turk who takes 
to the sea to pillage and burn, this 
character is a sailor and warrior, noth-
ing more, nothing less. For the right 
price, he’ll paint his shield with what-
ever banner he’s given — but he’s not 
just out for himself; he knows the value 
of a good strong team. One man alone 
can’t sail a ship, nor stand against a full 
town levy. Under the right captain, 
and for the right coin, he’s as reliable 
as the most honorable soldier, though 
perhaps more savage.
Coastal Raiders usually perform 
the dual service of warriors and sailors, 
and thus must draw Abilities from both 
skill sets. Suitable Virtues and Flaws are 
similar to those of the Sailor, and also 
Berserk, Warrior, and Infamous.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Forager, Sailor, 
Soldier
The Coward
Every turb has one: the unashamed 
Coward who never knowingly puts 
himself at risk. He’s a work-shy, easily 
intimidated weak link, and you can nev-
er be sure of trusting him. But he earns 
his place through exceptional puissance 
with a single Ability. The unwilling 
Coward can be coerced into stories, 
usually through threats, but provides 
an easy target for enemies to exploit. 
Alternatively, the Coward could be ut-
terly loyal to the covenant, but unable 
to force himself to face his fear.
The Coward is deﬁned through 
Personality Flaws to represent his 
cowardice, accompanied by a negative 
Brave Personality Trait. The deﬁning 
Flaw of a Coward is Fear — probably 
of something major like “combat.” 
These are balanced by both Afﬁnity 
and Puissance in his key expertise, 
such as Legerdemain or Guile. 
TRAINING PACKAGES: any
The  
Disenfranchised Knight
This is a nobleman, trained to the 
saddle, sword, and lance, but with no 
land nor privilege. He may be the 
bastard son of a Lord, who will never 
inherit because he has too many le-
gitimate brothers; he may have a 
reputation as a coward, so no one 
will meet him on the ﬁeld at tourna-
ment; or he may be a knight of worth 
whose father’s lands have been con-
ﬁscated by a usurping baron. There 
are noblewomen equivalents as well: 
for instance, an educated lady whose 
father cannot afford her dowry might 
prefer to join a covenant than be con-
signed to the nunnery.
A true knight is a courtier as well 
as a warrior, learning Etiquette and 
Intrigue alongside swordplay. Ride 
and Great Weapon are essential Abil-
ities for those hoping to win honor 
and reputation on the tourney ﬁeld. 
Suitable Virtues and Flaws include 
Gentleman, Warrior, and any Flaw 
representing his dishonor (such as In-
famous or Fear).
TRAINING PACKAGES: Courtier, Leader, 
Pikeman, Public Ofﬁcial, Rider, 
Soldier
The Field Chirurgeon
The chirurgeon does his or her 
part to ensure the health and well-be-


--- Page ---

141
Grogs
ing of the covenfolk. A ﬁghting force 
in particular has its life expectancy 
and efﬁciency increased by proper 
care. The chirurgeon may be a simple 
herbwife from the local village, or a 
formally trained nurse from a monas-
tic hospital. Or he might be a combat 
veteran with a little training and a lot 
of practice. Any may work alone, or 
as the assistant to a doctor of medi-
cine, depending on the covenant’s 
size and funding.
Key Abilities include Chirurgy, 
Leadership if he manages a staff of 
helpers, Survival if he accompanies 
the turb into the ﬁeld, and martial 
abilities if he is a combat medic. Folk 
Ken could be useful for putting his 
patients at ease. Suitable Virtues and 
Flaws include Puissant Chirurgy, Cau-
tious with Chirurgy, Compassionate, 
and Surgical Empiricus (see Art & Aca-
deme, page 55).
TRAINING PACKAGES: Cunning Man, 
Cutter, Forager, Local
The Fool
Fools and jesters entertain the lofty 
and the lowly alike, including magi of 
the Order. But a Fool may say things 
that others might not dare, perhaps 
at the behest of his master seeking to 
spar with a rival.
The Fool entertains his audience 
with wit through Charm and feats of 
juggling through Profession: Jongleur. 
Profession: Performer represents his 
singing ability, while Legerdemain al-
lows sleight of hand. Etiquette gives 
him knowledge of the acceptable 
boundaries while at court, all the bet-
ter to break them. Appropriate Virtues 
and Flaws include Free Expression, 
Perfect Balance, Troupe Upbringing 
and Small Frame.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Conman, Min-
strel, Storyteller, Tumbler, Wastrel
The Ghost
Covenants see much of death, 
but in the Magical aura common to 
so many covenants, death may not 
be a ﬁnal end. Ghosts haunt many 
covenants, and while magi may leave 
them to their ghostly hauntings, bind 
them to eternal servitude, or treat 
them as legitimate covenfolk, Ghosts 
that are able to leave the conﬁnes of 
the covenant make for unusual travel 
companions.
Ghostly grogs do not have a high 
Might Score and so are vulnerable, 
but they may each have unique Pow-
ers and Abilities that mirror their roles 
in life.
For suitable Virtues and Flaws, 
see Realms of Power: Magic, Chapter 3. 
Most Ghosts who are grogs have the 
same Abilities as in life, even though 
some of those Abilities are no longer 
relevant. However, a good Awareness, 
Area Lore, and Organization Lore: 
Covenant can be useful to those who 
are sufﬁciently gifted to perceive the 
Ghost’s presence.
The Hero
Preternaturally drawn to danger, 
the ﬁrst to volunteer when faced with 
overwhelming odds, and almost cer-
tainly destined for an early grave, The 
Hero is the consummate adventurer, 
always prepared for anything. He has 
a broad spread of Abilities, ensuring 
that he can climb the steepest slopes, 
swim the widest lakes, and ride the 
fastest horses. He is likely to be reck-
less in his approach to life, and have a 
lust for adventure. Others might ﬁnd 
him tiresome or intimidating because 
he expects others to be as brave and 
adventurous as he is himself. A cov-
enant is an obvious home for such a 
one seeking glory and renown, as it 


--- Page ---

142
Grogs
offers challenges far beyond the mor-
tal world.
The Hero usually has a good 
Athletics, Swim, Ride, and Survival 
Ability, representing his adventur-
ing spirit. Appropriate Virtues and 
Flaws include: Afﬁnity with Athlet-
ics, Warrior, Famous (or Infamous), 
and Reckless.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Athlete, Brawler, 
Leader, Soldier
The Laboratory 
Assistant
While older magi have appren-
tices, familiars, and perhaps even a 
clutch of enchanted automata to as-
sist them in the laboratory, younger 
magi appreciate the help of mundane 
hands. The Laboratory Assistant grog 
is well-educated and versed in Magic 
Theory and Magic Lore. The Labora-
tory Assistant cannot provide direct 
help to her master since she does not 
have The Gift, but she is a skilled 
craftswoman, repairing damaged ap-
paratus after accidents. If her master 
is particularly terrifying, she may be 
very good at Stealth; he may not even 
know she exists, but marvels that his 
sanctum remains tidy despite the oc-
casional destructive rampage. Because 
she is privy to her master’s secrets, she 
has a great deal of authority over the 
“lesser” servants.
Suitable Virtues and Flaws include 
Arcane Lore, Afﬁnity with Craft (any 
relevant), and Humble. Some Flaws 
might represent being caught in lab-
oratory accidents (such as Missing 
Eye, Fragile Constitution, and Poor 
Hearing).
TRAINING 
PACKAGES: 
Covenfolk, 
Craftsman, Magician, Servant
The Loyal Watchman
Always 
unnoticed 
and 
never 
catching the attention of the mas-
ters, the Loyal Watchman will never 
amount to much and he’d be surprised 
if the scholars even knew his name. 
He simply takes his pay, feeds his 
family, and raises the next generation 
of Loyal Watchmen.
The Loyal Watchman defends the 
covenant. He does not venture out 
with the magi and is nobody’s custos. 
But he knows the covenant like the 
back of his hand; it is all he has known. 
Every covenant has these downtrod-
den nameless grogs, but once in a 
while they come into their own and 
show their worth. Awareness is the 
key Ability of the Watchman, and he 
may well have a good local Area Lore, 
thanks to long months of intense ex-
ploration. Having spent a long time at 
the covenant, he may have developed 
a good Organization Lore: Covenant. 
Appropriate Virtues and Flaws include 
Puissant Awareness and Nocturnal.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Covenfolk, Lo-
cal, Sentry
The Ofﬁcer
Every ﬁghting turb needs a leader, 
and most have one. Depending on 
the size of the turb and the level of 
organization, the Ofﬁcer may be any-
thing from the most-senior ﬁghter to a 
knight or formally trained ofﬁcer.
Custos is a recommended Virtue, as 
is Warrior. He needs access to Martial 
Abilities, and a higher ofﬁcer needs to 
know Latin and be literate, in addition 
to basic arithmetic. Good Teacher or 
Puissance in favored abilities would 
help, or Inspirational for a captain. Key 
Abilities include Folk Ken, Leadership, 
Martial Abilities, Riding, and Teaching. 
Etiquette and various Organization and 
Area Lores apply as well.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Covenfolk, Lead-
er, Public Ofﬁcial, Trainer, Soldier
The Poisoner
The art of the apothecary is a sub-
tle one, when the difference between 
harming or healing a client can be as 
simple as a minim’s weight of a drug. 
It is not a career aimed at the clumsy 
or the careless, and yet sometimes 
individuals are expected to enter the 
family trade, no matter what their 
own wishes. However, the trade can 
also attract those individuals who en-
joy the power over life and death that 
they hold in their hands, or whose 
morals around poisoning are up for 
negotiation, if there is ﬁnancial gain 
in it.
Towns rarely tolerate an apoth-
ecary who poisons his patients, for 
whatever reason. After escaping from 
a lynch mob, the Poisoner can be of 
great use to bandits and other ne’er-
do-wells who live apart from society. 
Life is harsh for such individuals, and 
an apothecary can double as a chirur-
geon, as well as provide more effective 
ways of killing their marks. Similarly, a 
covenant can ﬁnd a use for a disgraced 
apothecary incapable of setting up 
trade in town, but can they ever really 
trust his nostrums?
Naturally, 
Profession: 
Apoth-
ecary is an important Ability for the 
Poisoner, and some may know Medi-
cine (or its folk equivalent) for mak-
ing more potent poisons. Many have

The Robber
The roads of Mythic Europe are 
rarely safe, largely due to robbers who 
extract their own tolls and taxes from 
those who pass. As an outlaw, the Rob-
ber may look at the covenant as a place 
of sanctuary where his crimes might be 
ignored and his value recognized.
The 
Robber 
has 
exceptional 
knowledge of the local area and his 
activities ensure that he learns about 
all manner of goings on. But for all his 
value, the covenant must occasionally 
face the consequences of his actions 
while protecting their own secrecy 
and reputation.
In addition to Area Lore (and 
the Robber may have several differ-
ent Area Lores), this character uses 
Stealth to lie in wait, and Leadership 
to intimidate his victims. Brawl is pos-
sibly more important than any Mar-
tial Abilities. Appropriate Virtues and 
Flaws include Warrior, Well-Traveled, 
and Branded Criminal.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Brawler, Footpad, 
Forager, Local, Soldier, Woodsman
The Sailor
Many covenants earn income from 
the sea, through ﬁshing or trade, and 
each ship needs a crew. While crews for 
these vessels have little to do with the 
Order, magi who undertake sea voyages 
would do well to retain a turb of Sailors.
The chief Ability is Profession: 
Sailor, but Area Lore for coastal areas 
is important. And for covenants that 
have built or bought enchanted ves-
sels, Finesse is useful as it helps the 
Sailor to control the ship’s enchant-
ments. But the Sailor’s loyalties are 
to his captain ﬁrst, his ship second, 
and then to the covenant. Appropri-
ate Virtues and Flaws include Cautious 
with Profession: Sailor, Wilderness 
Sense, and Craving for Travel*.
TRAINING PACKAGES: Fisherman, La-
borer, Sailor 
The Survivor
When covenants die, what hap-
pens to their grogs? In some cases, the 
covenfolk remain in the ruins of the 
covenant long after the magi have left 
or been killed by some terrible disaster. 
Perhaps they are trapped in a regio, or 
have nowhere else to go. The grogs be-
come warped over time by the aura, and 
after even a single generation are likely 
to be culturally different from their 
more mundane neighbors. For example, 
a simple desire that the magi will one 
day return and free them can be trans-
muted in later generations under the in-
ﬂuence of Warping to a messianic cult 
that treats magi as demi-gods.
Characters rescued from the ruins 
of a covenant may share common De-
lusions, have unusual Prohibitions, and 
have extreme Personality Traits. They 
may also suffer inherited Flaws from 
Warping, such as Warped Senses or 
Environmental Sensitivity (both from 
Realms of Power: Magic, Chapter 4).
TRAINING PACKAGES: Covenfolk, For-
ager, Woodsman
