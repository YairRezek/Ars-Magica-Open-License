Author Biographies
Niall Christie is (still) a medieval Islam historian who lives in Van-
couver, Canada. He likes books, history (no surprise there), roleplaying, 
tyranids, singing, and tormenting his students with antiquated pop-cul-
ture references that they don’t get. Niall would like to thank his co-au-
thors and the line editor for all their help, and in particular for picking 
up the magic lamp that he dropped; and also Guy Le Strange and Mu-
hammad ibn Jubayr, invaluable guides through the desert. He would like 
to dedicate his portion of this book to three people: to Matt Ryan, for 
setting this genie free; to Angus MacDonald, for much sheik, rattle, and 
roll; and to Steph van Willigenburg, for being his Water of Life.
Erik Dahl lives in a strange, far-off land with its own rules of magic 
and its own order of exotic wizards who are surely secretly plotting to 
take over Mythic Europe. His contributions to this book were inspired by 
and dedicated to the participants of Grand Tribunal America 2008, which 
took place August 15–17 in Berkeley, California, and included: Jerry 
Braverman, Paul Briscoe, Toshi Casey, Niall Christie, Mark Faulkner, Sal-
ly Hutchinson, Kurt Konegen, Angus MacDonald, Mark Pascual, John 
Post, Thomas Scott, Chris Van Horn, Eric Vesbit, and Debbi Winslow. 
Many thanks to all of you, for your help in establishing such a memorable 
and enjoyable magical tradition! ARS MAGICA AWESOME EST.
The jinni known as Jarkman (Lachie Hayes) hails from far beyond 
the Mountains of Qaf, in a city where it always rains and seasons change 
within a day. Perhaps one day he’ll master the Travel magic to attend a 
Grand Tribunal, but until then he’ll stick to Storytelling. Lachie thanks 
Niall for summoning him into this circle, then letting him loose to make 
mischief. He also thanks his other co-authors Alex, Erik, and Mark for 
their help and support along the way. Special thanks to Timothy Fer-
guson for inspiring Lachie to start writing seriously and helping him 
understanding faeries, which was invaluable for the Jinn and Silk Road 
chapters. Apologies to Marko and the Light of Andorra crowd for disap-
pearing without explanation just as the saga got going — now you know 
why. Lachie would most like to thank his wife, for putting up with Mid-
dle Eastern medieval madness. This is his first book for Ars Magica.
Mark Shirley is the descendent of Robert Shirley who, with his 
brothers, sold cannons to Shah Abbas of Persia on behalf of Queen 
Elizabeth I. Robert married the Shah’s ward, Teresia, a Circassian prin-
cess, and became the shah’s ambassador to Christendom. Mark feels 
his Persian bloodline, though many generations diluted, enhanced his 
enjoyment of writing for this project.
Alexander White has an Honours degree in medieval and classical 
history, and a Master of Public Policy and Management from the Uni-
versity of Melbourne. In between occasionally publishing Sub Rosa (an 
Ars Magica fan magazine), Alex works as the campaigns coordinator 
for the National Tertiary Education Union in Melbourne, Australia.
Ars Magica players participate in a thriving fan community by subscribing to email discussion lists (like the Berke-
ley list), compiling archives of game material (such as Project Redcap), maintaining fan-created web sites, and running

Ahlan wa sahlan! Welcome to The Cradle 
and the Crescent, the guide to the Mythic 
Middle East for Ars Magica Fifth Edition. 
This book explores a part of the Mythic 
world beyond the control of the Order of 
Hermes, including the lands known in the 
modern day as the “cradle of civilization,” 
from which our earliest records of human 
civilization stem — the lands to the east of 
the Hermetic Tribunal of the Levant, lands 
known in Europe only through occasional 
accounts of pilgrims and other travelers, 
supplemented by a multitude of (at times 
wild) rumors and speculations.
In this book we present this region as a 
setting for Ars Magica sagas. We describe 
the geography and history of the area, in-
cluding in particular many of its mystical 
sites and supernatural denizens. ­We also 
give particular attentio­n to Mythic Middle 
Eastern magic, the jinn, Mythic Zoroastri-
anism, and the Suhhar Sulayman that is also 
known as the Order of Suleiman.
How to Use 
This Book
This book is intended as a full-blown 
setting for sagas and adventures, with the 
expectation that it will be a source for sto-
ries set within the region. The text assumes 
that there is no existing Hermetic presence 
in the area but, throughout the book, you 
will find story seeds that are intended to 
draw Hermetic magi and their followers 
away from their covenants and lead them to 
the lands of the Middle East. The following 
are just some of the possibilities that this 
book offers to players of Ars Magica sagas.
First, you may simply use the rules 
here to develop exotic characters to sup-
plement your covenant’s membership, be 
they spirit-summoning sahirs, impetuous 
jinn, or mysterious Zoroastrian mobeds 
(see Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively).
Second, this book provides tools for 
you to build an exotic story arc, or excit-
ing adventures set in the region or the su-
pernatural realms it contacts, as a diversion 
from a conventional Europe-based saga. 
You may also choose to use the information 
on Middle Eastern magic and the Order of 
Suleiman to develop powerful non-Her-
metic antagonists or allies for your saga.
Alternatively, you may wish to set your 
entire saga in the region, in the form of a 
new covenant of Hermetic magi striking 
out into lands previously unexplored by 
the Order, encountering the various chal-
lenges and magical traditions of the area.
Finally, and most adventurously, you 
can cast Hermetic magi aside entirely, 
playing a group of Middle Eastern mages 
and their companions seeking to make a 
name for themselves, and immersing your 
troupe entirely in the region.
We have not given full details on every 
place, creature, or supernatural item found 
within this book. We have given suggested 
statistics for some of these, but in many 
cases the precise statistics will depend on 
the power level of your saga. Thus our main 
emphasis has been on providing the legends 
and stories that may be used as inspiration.
On the Setting
In the minds of the people of Mythic 
Europe, the Middle East is a distant and 
strange place, home to all manner of mon-
sters, spirits, sorcerers, and kings — full 
of great wonders for those who are brave 
enough to seek them out. This book re-
flects this perception by heightening the 
level of supernatural activity in the region. 
Most people of the Mythic Middle East 
have no less respect for the supernatural 
than do their counterparts in the West, 
but they are also much more used to en-
countering such elements. By adopting 
this vision of the region we will frequently 
be doing violence to the historical reali-
ties of the period, though many of the su-
pernatural elements that we mention are 
based on beliefs and ideas expressed in 
historical sources from the time. However, 
it is important to remember that this is 
not a book on Middle Eastern history; it 
is instead a supplement for the Ars Magica 
roleplaying game that merely draws inspi-
ration from the historical texts.
Strangers in  
Foreign Lands
Broadly speaking, characters who are 
members of other faiths living under Islam 
follow the usual guidelines for character 
creation, although very few are members of 
the nobility, and none may be members of 
the religious classes. Many Christians living 
under Islam are involved in the civil admin-
istration, while many Jews are merchants.
The Jews are, for the most part, ortho-
dox Rabbinites, though some Karaites do 
still live in the region. The Exilarch — the 
spiritual head of the Jewish community — 
lives in Baghdad, making it an important 
city for the Jews, at least in theory.
The situation with regard to the Chris-
tians is rather more complex, as there are a 
large number of different Christian groups 
living in the region covered by this book. 
Chapter One
Introduction & Sagas

The Cradle & The Crescent
Melkites (Greek Orthodox) are most of-
ten found in Byzantine territory and the 
Levant, but there are some scattered com-
munities further east, left over from the 
days when the Byzantines controlled terri-
tories in the northern Jazira, Armenia, and 
Georgia. Jacobites (Syrian Orthodox) are 
most often found in Syria and the Holy 
Land, but some Jacobites may be found in 
Arabia. Ethiopian Christianity has made 
some inroads into southwestern Arabia. 
The Church of the East (Nestorian Chris-
tianity) is most significantly represented in 
Iraq and Persia, outside of the former Ro-
man and Byzantine empires.
Tensions among these various branch-
es of Christianity and Judaism, and indeed 
among different groups of Muslim and 
Zoroastrian believers as well, could lead 
to stories as members of different factions 
attempt to employ the characters in or-
der to gain an advantage over their rivals. 
Schisms over points of doctrine can easily 
flare up into violence, especially if super-
natural forces become involved.
Almost all non-Muslim characters liv-
ing under Muslim rule must also take the 
Minor General Flaw Dhimmi (DHIM-
me), described at the end of ths chapter. 
Exceptions tend to be those outside the 
social order, and hence beyond or beneath 
the notice of the Muslim authorities. Her-
metic magi are the most obvious examples 
of such exceptions.
Social Structure
The nominal head of the Muslim 
world, at least for Sunnis, is the caliph in 
Baghdad. Serving him (at least theoreti-
cally) are the governors of various territo-
ries known as sultans (sul-TAWNZ). Both 
the caliph and these rulers are served by 
viziers, who run their civil and military ad-
ministration for them. Beneath the caliph, 
sultans, and viziers are three main classes 
involved in running society: the military 
elite, the civil elite, and the religious elite 
(also called the ‘ulama’ (‘u-la-MEH’), “the 
erudite,” sing.‘alim (‘EH-lim)). Each class 
is arranged in an approximate hierarchy, 
though not in such a rigid fashion as in 
Europe. There are several other groups in 
Islamic society. The peasants, or fallahun 
(fal-leh-HOON), work the land, much 
like European peasants. They are free sub-
jects of the ruler, not bound to the land in 
the way that some European peasants are. 
Merchants ply their trade in cities.
The Muslim world is home to many 
who follow a number of other faiths, in-
cluding Christians and Jews. These people 
are designated in Islamic law as ahl al-kitab 
(AHL-ul-ki-TEHB), “the people of the 
Muslim Views of Europeans
Muslim relations with the Europe-
ans, whom they call ifranj (i-FRANJ) 
or Franks, regardless of country of ori-
gin, are best described as mixed. Some 
Muslims are openly hostile towards if-
ranj, particularly during periods of con-
flict, but others have established more 
friendly relations. Some rulers find they 
benefit from diplomatic and mercantile 
contact with the European states, and 
one even occasionally finds Muslim and 
European rulers allying with one an-
other against other Muslim or European 
rulers. Those Muslims who have had 
closer contact with Europeans tell tales 
of strange and unfathomable customs 
and practices that make little sense to 
the Muslim mind.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Mythic Middle East in Ars Magica
This is not the first supplement to 
deal with topics Middle Eastern, and 
players may find it helpful to consult 
other Ars Magica supplements when 
running sagas that make use of the mate-
rial contained herein. This section lists 
the supplements that contain significant 
content pertaining to the Middle East.
Realms of Power: The Divine 
This is the most important supple-
ment in this regard, containing informa-
tion on both the mundane and super-
natural characteristics of the three major 
monotheistic faiths, all of which have 
their origins in the greater Middle East-
ern region, either the Holy Land, within 
the Tribunal of the Levant, or Arabia, far 
beyond its borders, and all of which have 
members who live in the area covered by 
this supplement. The rules presented on 
character creation are also of particular 
use, especially for generating Muslim and 
Jewish characters from the Middle East. 
Realms of Power: The Infernal 
This book also provides much in-
formation that will be useful for Middle 
Eastern sagas. In addition, it contains 
some background information on the 
Jinn (page 26) and includes rules that 
may be used to create infernally cor-
rupted Jinn. It also gives information on 
the Mazzikim, a group of demons that 
include some infernal Jinn in their ranks 
(page 73), and describes a demoness 
who masquerades as a jinniyya (Aqrab 
the Conjuror, pages 58-59). A Zoroas-
trian demon, Naonhaithya, is also de-
tailed (pages 73-74). In addition, it de-
tails a Middle Eastern Infernal tradition, 
the Mulhidun (pages 136-137), who are 
found principally in the Jazira.
Realms of Power: Magic 
This book contains rules that may 
be used to create Magical Jinn, includ-
ing some commentary on these creatures 
(pages 106-107 in particular).
Realms of Power: Faerie 
This book contains information that 
may be used to create Faerie Jinn and 
those who deal with them. It also con-
tains examples of Middle Eastern faeries, 
Lamashtu (page 64-65) and the Ghula 
(page 72); describes how to create char-
acters with Ghula Blood (page 106); and 
provides various suggestions for incor-
porating elements from Middle Eastern 
folk tales into Ars Magica sagas.
The Mysteries Revised Edition 
This book includes a number of mys-
teries that draw on the magical tradi-
tions of the Middle East. These include 
Hermetic Alchemy (pages 39-46) and 
Hermetic Astrology (pages 47-57), and 
a journey to the east could form an ap-
propriate part of an Initiation Script for 
both the Order of the Green Cockerel 
and the Magoi of the Star. By the same 
token, the Legion of Mithras (pages 118-
22), should it ever decide to explore its 
possible links to ancient Zoroastrianism, 
could require Initiates to travel to Persia 
to investigate as an Initiation Quest.
Houses of Hermes:  
Mystery Cults 
This book includes brief information 
on the Keepers of Tales, a Merinita sub-
tradition originating in the Middle East 
(pages 81-82). It also presents the Cri-
amon Path of Walking Backwards, which 
was inspired by Sufi mysticism, along 
with information on its founder, the Pri-
mus Abdkypris (pages 56 and 70-73).
Houses of Hermes: Societates
The description of the Hermetic 
sahirs in Houses of Hermes: Societates, while 
concerning itself with an Iberian tradi-
tion of Islamic magi, also includes infor-
mation on the Jinn, including a sample 
character, Wahhab (pages 133-136).
Ancient Magic 
This book describes some of the mag-
ical secrets that might be found in the re-
gion covered by this book, including the 
language of Adam, ancient Babylon, the 
Garden of Eden and Cain (pages 10-29); 
a source of Grigori magic on Mount Ara-
rat (pages 70-73) and the Altars of Alex-
ander the Great (page 125). Information 
on some of the naming conventions used 
in the Middle East may also be found 
(page 46). On more on names, see also 
Appendix A in this book.
Hedge Magic Revised Edition 
This book describes two traditions of 
Islamic elementalists, the Ikhwan al-Safa’ 
and the Tulab ibn Sina (pages 28-32). Mid-
dle Eastern counterparts to Folk Witches 
(pages 33-53), Learned Magicians (see 
pages 79-99) and Mythic Alchemists 
(page 100) are possible with only minor 
modifications to fit an Islamic setting. 
Characters descended from nomadic 
shamans of the northern steppe tribes or 
deep deserts of Arabia may be represent-
ed by the rules for Nightwalkers (pages 
102-118).
Rival Magic 
This book gives details about Soqo-
tra, an island in the Gulf of Aden south 
of Yemen ruled by non-Hermetic sorcer-
ers and their magical tree spirit compan-
ions. This book also details the Amazons 
and their magical tradition descended 
from Trianoma’s sister Veia — the war-
rior women are based on an island in the 
Sea of Khazars (the Caspian Sea) but 
hunting parties may have ranged into 
Khwarazm or further. Both groups may 
be potential allies or enemies in sagas set 
in the Mythic Middle East.

book,” and are permitted to live in Muslim 
lands as long as they accept the status of 
dhimmis. The subject peoples are required 
to pay a special poll tax, the jizya (JIZ-ya), 
and to abide by a number of restrictions in 
society, including refraining from bearing 
arms, riding animals with saddles, building 
new places of worship, or attempting to 
convert others to their faith. Their abil-
ity to testify in court is restricted, and the 
value of their testimony is less than that 
of Muslim men. Sometimes they are also 
required to wear distinctive dress. How 
strictly these restrictions are actually en-
forced varies from ruler to ruler.
Islam & Islamic Law
Islam is both a religion and a social 
contract, and so the law humans should 
use to regulate their lives is contained in 
its teachings. There are a number of sourc-
es Muslims use for this law, which is called 
in Arabic al-shari’a (ash-sha-REE-‘a). 
Crime and Punishment
The shari’a divides crimes into three 
main categories:
• Deliberate killing or wounding, giv-
ing the victim or their family the right 
to exact vengeance, under the control 
of the authorities. In some cases, ven-
geance can be replaced by a ransom.
• Accidental killing or wounding, dealt 
with by financial settlement.
• Five major crimes, dealt with using 
canonical penalties called hudud (hu-
DOOD). They include theft (pun-
ished by cutting off the right hand), 
brigandage (death, if a murder in-
volved; otherwise as theft), adultery 
(stoning or flogging), false accusation 
of adultery (flogging), and use of alco-
hol (flogging).
Some other crimes also incur severe 
penalties. For example, apostasy is pun-
ished by death. Less serious offenses are 
punished with a verbal reprimand. Islamic 
law often requires a number of witnesses to 
a crime, making it difficult to impose pen-
alties without adequate proof and moderat-
ing the more severe penalties somewhat.
Magic is permitted in Islam, as long as it 
is used for good purposes. Use of magic for 
evil purposes, on the other hand, is punish-
able by beheading. Thus, while Dominion 
auras generated by Muslims affect magic as 
normal, the attitude of the Muslim inhabit-
ants of these auras toward practitioners of 
magic is likely to be more nuanced. In par-
ticular, an accusation of use of evil magic is 
likely to be subject to the same legal pro-
cesses as any other alleged crime.
The Pillars of Islam
The Muslim life is encapsulated in 
five basic duties, known as arkan al-islam 
(ar-KEHN-ul-is-LEHM), or the pillars of 
Islam. These are as follows:
• Shahada (sha-HEH-da), or testimony: 
Muslims witness to their faith through 
two statements, which signify conver-
sion to the faith. These are “la ilaha illa 
Allah” (there is no god except God) 
and “Muhammadun rasul Allah” (Muham-
mad is the messenger of God). These 
are repeated regularly as part of the 
ritual prayers.
• Salat (sa-LAWT), or prayer: Muslims 
must perform ritual prayer five times 
every day, at fixed times.
• Zakat (za-KEHT), or alms-tax: All 
Muslims who are able are required to 
give a portion of their wealth as chari-
ty. Exactly where it is actually directed 
varies, depending on the political and 
social situations in any given place.
• Sawm (SOWM), or fasting: All able-
bodied Muslims are required to fast 
during Ramadan (ra-ma-DAWN), the 
The Unholy Trinity
Medieval European Christians had 
many misconceptions about Islam, per-
haps the most common of which was 
that Muslims worshiped an unholy trin-
ity composed of three deities known as 
Mahound, Termagant, and Apollyon. In 
Ars Magica these three figures are de-
mons of the Order of False Gods (see 
Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 37), who 
seek to foment hostility between Chris-
tians and Muslims. They may be found 
operating anywhere within Europe or 
the Middle East, whispering their vicious 
lies into the ears of any who might listen. 
Like most False Gods, the demons usu-
ally take forms that will appeal to their 
listeners. In their original forms, though, 
they appear as follows:
• The demon Mahound takes the form 
of a grotesque parody of a monothe-
istic prophet, clothing itself in fine 
robes of green silk and gold, and 
leering at those around it. It has im-
mense ears, intended to mock the 
fact that such prophets heard the 
divine revelation.
• Termagant takes the form of a hag 
with an incredibly wrinkled face and 
bulging eyes, literally spitting venom 
at any who oppose it. It has sharp, 
jagged fingernails with which it claws 
at its opponents’ eyes.
• Apollyon appears on first glance to 
be a twisted parody of the Greco-
Roman Apollo, a hunchbacked, hid-
eously ugly blond man with a lyre, 
dressed only in an oversized, ill-fit-
ting golden cloak. The cloak drips 
with acid and the lyre produces jan-
gling dissonances that set teeth on 
edge and paralyze the senses.
This unholy trinity might form a 
suitable arch-enemy in a saga, particular-
ly one that draws characters from west-
ern Mythic Europe into the lands of the 
Mythic Middle East and involves char-
acters with both Christian and Muslim 
friends and allies. Characters are likely 
to spend much of their time promoting 
friendly relations between these groups 
while seeking to track down and combat 
those who are nurturing discord.

ninth month of the Muslim year and 
the month when Muhammad first be-
gan to receive the revelation. Fasting is 
undertaken from sunrise to sunset, and 
includes abstention from food, drink 
and sexual activity. 
• Hajj (HADJ), or pilgrimage: All Mus-
lims who are able are required to make 
the major pilgrimage to Mecca at least 
once during their lives. Further details 
on the hajj are given in the section on 
the Hijaz in the Mecca section (See 
Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia).
Each pillar has associated mechanical 
effects, detailed further in Realms of Power: 
The Divine, pages 106-108.
Mosques
Mosques serve several purposes, for in 
addition to prayer one finds other activi-
ties taking place in them, including public 
orations, readings of the Qur’an, Sufi ritu-
als, and religious festivals.
A mosque generally takes the form of 
an open central space, usually a courtyard 
or hall, surrounded on three sides by a pil-
lared arcade and on the fourth side, which 
is the one closest to Mecca, by an open, 
pillared hall. In the wall closest to Mecca 
there is a mihrab (MIH-rahb), or prayer 
niche, which indicates the way which 
worshipers should face when praying, and 
a minbar (MIN-bar), or pulpit, from which 
sermons are preached. A mosque also of-
ten has a water source for ablutions, fre-
quently in the form of a fountain or pool 
in the courtyard.
Mosques have a Dominion aura that 
varies in power according to their size and 
importance. Most mosques have a Domin-
ion aura of 4, while major, famous mosques 
will usually have auras of 5, though this may 
increase by a point or two if relics are kept 
in them. The auras of mosques increase if 
prayer is performed in them or if those in-
side are performing the Ramadan fast.
Building Sagas
The Mythic Middle East is a settting 
that’s ripe for long-running Ars Magica sa-
gas. Encourage your player characters to 
build a new Hermetic covenant in these 
lands, explore conflict and alliances be-
tween the wizards in a mixed group of 
Hermetic magi and sahirs, or make all 
your characters members of the Order of 
Suleiman and their servants. The Mythic 
Middle East awaits you!
Founding a Covenant in 
the Mythic Middle East
Founding a Hermetic covenant in the 
potentially hostile lands of the Mythic 
Middle East creates a challenging start-
ing scenario. While perhaps better suited 
for more experienced troupes, this option 
adds the elements of direct potential magi-
cal confrontation, isolation from the wider 
Order, and the tantalizing option of non-
Hermetic integration and discovery into a 
conventional beginning. Combining great 
freedom with great danger, such Sagas 
would rely heavily on cooperation among 
individual magi to survive and prosper. A 
group of Seeker magi from various back-
grounds looking to delve into the ancient 
non-Hermetic mysteries of the cradle of 
civilization would be an example of this. 
An isolated area, such as the deeper des-
erts (see Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia and 
Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia) or the 
less-settled eastern provinces (see Chap-
ter 9: On the Silk Road), may be the most 
suitable location for a Hermetic colony.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Founding a Chapter House
Similar to founding a new covenant, 
but relying on the tradition begun in the 
Greater Alps and prevalent in the Rhine, 
this option is perhaps more attainable for 
a starting troupe. Sponsorship by one of 
the established Greater Alps covenants, 
one of the domus magna, or perhaps 
the highly resourced and expansionistic 
Fengheld covenant of the Rhine would 
be a prerequisite. This scenario trades 
off some of the danger and isolation by 
sacrificing freedom — having the young 
magi beholden to the politics and agen-
das of senior magi and the wider Order in 
what is an unstable and charged region. 
The chapter house may act as an offen-
sive bridgehead, an embassy to the Order 
of Suleiman, a trading post, an original 
research base, a translation school or a 
combination of these ideas. For an exist-
ing European saga, this option provides 
an introduction to the Mythic Middle 
East and the potential for long-term play 
without requiring too much initial com-
mitment or research on the part of the 
storyguide or players. This scenario is 
dependent on some form of constant link 
between the Hermetic colony and the 
motherhouse such as a Mercere Portal, 
although such a gateway creates a large 
security liability should the covenant’s 
defenses be breached.
Itinerant Covenants
This choice reflects a group of mo-
bile magi and provides almost unlimited 
choice of adventures and the opportunity 
to fully explore the material contained in 
this book. The lack of a permanent settle-
ment may create issues for Hermetic magi 
heavily interested in laboratory work, and 
both mundane and supernatural security 
issues come to the fore. This scenario 
may work best for a more low-magic style 
saga where the stories are predominantly 
companion-based or require magi with 
more diplomacy than magical firepower. 
The covenant may be posing as simple 
merchants, acting as an advanced recon-
naissance party for the Order, or pursu-
ing another explicit magical goal that re-
quires travel through the Mythic Middle 
East. The Itineris Serica covenant (see 
sidebar in Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) 
details a suggestion for a Seeker covenant 
dedicated to discovering the mythical 
land of Serica, at the end of the fabled 
Silk Route.
Joining a House of Wisdom
Perhaps the most complex and pro-
vocative of Hermetic-based scenarios, 
in this option a small group of magi join 
an existing bayt al-hikma (“House of Wis-
dom,” pl. buyut) of agreeable sahirs. As the 
Houses of Wisdom are places of teaching 
as well as gathering places for unGifted 
sahirs, Gifted magi may be welcome as 
fellow scholars if they agree to respect 
their culture and laws of their hosts. Such 
an inter-Order community creates numer-
ous tensions and conflicts, although it is 
possible that the group may be able to 
cooperate and prosper despite the consid-
erable external pressures and initial differ-
ences. Magical techniques may be com-
pared and traded, although teaching the 
Parma Magica to an outsider would spark 
a violent Wizard’s War and March against 
the traitors unless the sahirs agreed to join 
one of the Societates or Mystery Cults of 
the Order first.
Tales of Two Orders
There are several scenarios that could 
potentially involve Hermetic magi with 
their Order of Suleiman counterparts in 
the Mythic Middle East, ranging from 
overt conflict or guerilla warfare, to un-
easy standoff, through to diplomatic 
overtures and peaceful cooperation and 
alliance. See Chapter 3: The Order of 
Suleiman for further details on sahirs and 
their culture.
Soft Places: Tales into the Supernatural
The Thousand and One Nights tells of 
Baluqiya, son of the once-Jewish king of 
Cairo, who traveled far beyond the mor-
tal world. Led by the mythical jinniyya 
known as the Queen of Serpents, the 
prince walked across seas, over moun-
tains, and through deserts to magical 
lands and kingdoms ruled by giants and 
jinn alike. Criamon magi believe that 
this oral legend, like their own Travels of 
Fedoso, is an allegorical description of a 
journey into the Magic Realm to outside 
the Circle of Time. Merinita magi of the 
Keepers of Tales cult disagree, claiming 
that the White Lands, Mountains of Qaf, 
and other countries alluded to in the 
myth lie within the Faerie realm, border-
ing on or being part of Jinnistan. Jinn of 
all Realms act as guardians, guides, and 
sponsors of such stories and are integral 
to journeys into these mystical locales. 
Whatever the truth behind such 
tales, the Mythic Middle East abounds 
with portals both physical and meta-
phorical into the supernatural Realms of 
Faerie and Magic. Golden Baghdad lies 
as a Faerie reflection of the mundane city, 
swarming with characters from the tales 
and folklore of the region. Merchants ply 
trade routes that cross supernatural bor-
ders and return with fabulous treasures 
from fantastic and mysterious lands.
Rumors abound of portals into Faer-
ie or the Magic Realm contained within 
the books containing the various tales 
— whether this represents a non-Her-
metic ritual effect instilled by the sor-
cerers among the jinn or if the books are 
actually an unusual form of faery acting 
as Threshold Guardians is unclear.
In the Mythic Middle East, the 
characters of the Arabian Nights are not 
just stories — they are woven into the 
everyday landscape. The player charac-
ters in turn are the threads that weave 
themselves into the fabric of the exist-
ing tales adding highlights and accents. 
This book is the loom on which you, 
the storyguide, can create a tapestry of 
adventure to rival the greatest adven-
tures of Haroun al-Raschid, Sinbad and 
Mar’auf the Cobbler.
See Chapter 4: The Jinn for more 
details on the jinn and their lands.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Hermetic Crusades
The conflict between medieval Chris-
tendom and Islam is not completely con-
fined to the Levant and Egypt. Hermetic 
magi have become aware of the Order of 
Suleiman through the supernatural actions 
of individual Syrian sahirs in battles between 
the invading Franks and the local forces of 
Salah al-Din. Seeking to trace back this 
threat to its source, more aggressive Her-
metic magi may seek to penetrate behind 
the battle lines to combat their perceived 
enemies on their home turf. Others may 
seek out the legendary armies of Prester 
John said to dwell far to the east, or search 
for allies among the encroaching Mongol 
horde. Even now, a major war against the 
Order of Hermes may be brewing.
The Followers of  
the Circle Return
Although isolated from their eastern 
brethren since the early tenth century, the 
Hermetic sahirs of Iberia have not forgot-
ten their origins, even if their knowledge 
of Solomonic Magic has long since faded 
beneath the protection of the Code of 
Hermes. Younger Iberian sahirs opposed 
to the reconquest of their lands by the 
northern Christian principalities may seek 
out their lost eastern brethren for support 
or magical weapons to use in the war to 
defend Andalusia from the vengeful sci-
ons of Alfonso the Battler and Flambeau 
the Founder. The successful involvement 
of the Order of Suleiman in the Iberian 
conflict would have wide-reaching conse-
quences for the relationship between the 
two Orders, potentially precluding any at-
tempts at peace for decades to come.
An Hermetic Embassy?
In 1220, a new danger breaks in the 
east — the latest in a wave of nomadic 
hordes from the mysterious steppes. Led 
by the mysterious figure known as Geng-
his Khan, the Mongols first begin their as-
sault on eastern Islam but reports of their 
savagery begin to filter back to western 
Mythic Europe. Despite their differences, 
the Order of Hermes and the Solomonic 
magi may see the threat of the encroaching 
Mongols as great enough to force an alli-
ance, at least temporarily. Such enforced 
cooperation and intermingling may have 
profound effects on the culture, magic and 
future of the two great supernatural orga-
nizations of Mythic Europe. Will such an 
uneasy truce last long enough to stave off 
the nomad threat?
Magi of a  
Different Order
Although the majority of material in 
this book is designed for use with Her-
metic magi as the protagonists, the various 
resources can all be used to support a saga 
where the magi are sahirs of the Order of 
Suleiman detailed in Chapter 3. The de-
fault option for this is a group of sahirs us-
ing a common bayt al-hikma as the equiv-
alent of a “covenant” and meeting place, 
although Gifted sahirs may live apart from 
their fellows in a separate location that 
forms the equivalent of a chapter house. 
Baghdad alone has several hundred sahirs 
who congregate and meet in at least half 
a dozen buyut, although only a few hun-
dred live within the actual city limits. The 
“covenfolk” can include both the mundane 
and magical servants of the sahirs, as well 
as associated Middle Eastern hedge magi-
cians visiting or studying at the site, adapt-
ing the rules in Covenants. As a collective of 
powerful individual wizards with different 
magic and personalities, the members of a 
bayt al-hikma can engage in all the poten-
tial activities, challenges, squabbles, and 
adventures that would be encountered in 
a conventional Hermetic saga.
As the majority of sahirs lack The Gift 
and are less interested in laboratory activi-
ties, such a saga might involve a greater 
degree of interaction with the mundane 
world and more high fantasy, adventure-
based story arcs. Opponents and challeng-
es to such a group of non-Hermetic magi 
could be based around local threats, in-
cluding the splinter Nizari assassins, devi-
ous jinn, the Mongol hordes, or the politi-
cal machinations of the feuding dynasties 
of the region. Alternatively, the sahirs may 
venture further afield into western Mythic 
Europe and participate in stories where 
they interact with Hermetic magi, Euro-
pean Faeries, and the Christian church.
See “The Middle East in Ars Magica” 
insert later and Chapter 3: The Order of 
Suleiman for further resources for playing 
a fully non-Hermetic Saga.
Thus spoke Zarathustra ...
The descendants of the Zoroastrian 
priests that once dominated Persian poli-
tics and magic are now a scattered handful 
of wizards in danger of extinction. Zoro-
astrian magi form a small mystery cult of 
holy magi within the Order of Hermes 
and a handful of sahirs still quietly follow 
the ancient Mazdean faith. Isolated villag-
es of faithful cling to their customs amidst 
persecution and distrust within the wider 
medieval Caliphate. A disparate collec-
tive of Zoroastrian wizards from different 
backgrounds and across Mythic Europe 
may attempt to unite their shattered faith 
by establishing a community under their 
combined protective magic (see Chapter 
War on Two Fronts?
The requirements on a member of 
the Order of Suleiman are less strict 
than those of the Order of Hermes, re-
quiring only the demonstration of some 
form of summoning power. However, 
although the Code may permit join-
ing the Order of Suleiman, any Her-
metic magi undertaking a second oath 
may be viewed with extreme suspicion. 
Likewise, although non-Hermetic sahirs 
may find sponsorship into House Ex 
Miscellanea, they will face opposition 
from hostile Hermetic elements such 
as House Flambeau and even their lost 
cousins, the Hermetic sahirs of Iberia. 
Thus despite being able to achieve in-
ternal harmony, such a group of mixed 
magi may find itself ostracized by both 
Orders, facing powerful enemies on two 
separate fronts.

for their people to shelter from the forces 
of Ahriman or be tempted to establish a 
base from which to re-carve the former 
greatness of their pre-Islamic empire?
Holy Knives of Alamut
The Nizari sect of assassins has one 
goal in mind: the institution of an Isma’ili 
state through the elimination of the Shi’a 
and Sunni rulers. They show remarkable 
adaptability in the pursuit of this goal, 
employing whatever tools come to hand: 
religious zealots willing to die for their 
masters, their own peculiar brand of mag-
ic, diplomacy at the point of a knife, and 
perhaps even the Order of Hermes. To 
the Nizaris, the Order of Suleiman is part 
of the problem and, much as they have 
helped the Crusaders against the occupy-
ing forces of Jerusalem, they might be pre-
pared to help Hermetic magi against their 
sahir enemies. If this means that the Niz-
aris first have to convince the Order that 
it has sahir enemies, the sect is not beyond 
manufacturing situations to persuade them 
of this. If the Order still seems reluctant, 
the Nizaris might attempt to directly co-
erce individuals by kidnapping and extor-
tion; of course, this might drive the Order 
towards allying with the sahirs against a 
Nizari threat. One thing is sure: with the 
Nizaris involved, blood will be spilled (see 
Chapter 8: Mythic Persia for more details 
on the medieval Nizari assassins).
Characters
Mythic Middle Eastern characters, be 
they rural or urban in origin, are generated 
in the same way as other characters but 
some Virtues and Flaws require renaming 
or minor alterations. They have access to 
some additional Virtues and Flaws, as well. 
Finally, two new Academic Knowledges 
are also described: Theology: Islam and 
Islamic Law.
Virtues
Educated (Islamic)
Minor, General
The character has been educated in a 
mosque or Qur’an school. The 50 experi-
ence points should be spent on some or all 
of Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Theolo-
gy: Islam, Islamic Law and Artes Liberales, 
due to a different education “system.”
Flaws
Dhimmi
Minor, General
The character is a non-Muslim born 
under Muslim rule. If he is adult and male, 
he must pay the jizya, and all dhimmis 
must abide by certain social restrictions 
(described earlier), in return for which they 
receive tolerance and protection from the 
Muslim authorities. The Judged Unfairly 
or Outsider flaws are more appropriate 
for European-born characters who travel 
through Muslim lands or permanently 
settle in the Mythic Middle East.
New Abilities
Islamic Law*
Academic
This is the Muslim version of Civil & 
Canon Law. The major sources of Islamic 
Law are the Qur’an and the Sunna. Spe-
cialties: any one of the sources of Islamic 
Law, particular topics, customs of a par-
ticular area.
Theology: Islam*
Academic
This is the Islamic equivalent of Chris-
tian Theology. The major sources for 
Islamic theology are the Qur’an and the 
Sunna. Specialties: the Qur’an, debates, 
history, prophets.

And the Lord God planted a garden in 
Eden, in the east; and there he put the man 
whom he had formed.	
	
	
	
            — The Bible, Genesis 2:8
In Mythic Europe, scholars trace the 
origins of humanity to the Middle East 
and to the final acts of creation undertaken 
by God, when Adam and Eve were created 
to tend the Garden of Eden at the junction 
of the Pison, Gihon, Euphrates, and Hid-
dekkel (or Tigris) rivers. They ate of the 
forbidden Tree of Knowledge and were 
driven from the garden. Worse was to fol-
low, with the casting-down of the Tower 
of Babel and eventually the Great Flood, 
which destroyed almost all of humanity.
The Ancient 
Empires
In the wake of the flood, the earth was 
repopulated, and the Middle East became 
home to a series of empires that dominated 
the region. At its center, on the crescent 
of land known as Mesopotamia, between 
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the an-
cient peoples developed the earliest form 
of writing, and there appeared city-states 
that traded or warred with one another as 
the inclination suited them. Dynasties of 
rulers rose and fell, including various Bab-
ylonian and Assyrian kings, some of whom 
ruled empires that stretched as far west as 
the Holy Land and Syria. Meanwhile, the 
lands to the east of Mesopotamia were 
home to a variety of peoples living either 
as nomads or in urban centers.
The ancient Mesopotamians were pa-
gans, worshiping a variety of deities, most 
of whom were powerful faerie creatures 
that demanded worship from mortals. 
These pagan practices were to be their 
downfall, however. In 539 BC, the Baby-
lonian king Belshazzar provoked the ire of 
God by drinking from the sacred vessels of 
the temple of Jerusalem, which had been 
taken by his forefather Nebuchadnezzar 
when he led the Jews of the Holy Land 
into captivity. Three days after this act, his 
empire was overthrown by the armies of 
Cyrus the Great, who had united the Per-
sians and adopted Zoroastrianism, becom-
ing an instrument of the Lord’s wrath in 
the face of this profanation.
Cyrus and his successors ruled the 
Middle East until the late fourth century 
BC, when they were overthrown by the 
Greeks under Alexander the Great. After 
Alexander’s death in 323 BC, the Middle 
East came under the control of one of his 
generals, who founded the Seleucid dy-
nasty that ruled in the region until its con-
quest by the Romans from the west and 
the Persian Parthians from the east in the 
second century BC. Thereafter, the Middle 
East became divided between the Romans 
and, later, the Byzantines, on the one side, 
against whom stood the Persian dynasties 
of the Parthians and their successors, the 
Sassanids, on the other. The situation re-
mained thus until the seventh century AD, 
when a new force entered the scene.

The Sacred Vessels
What became of the sacred vessels 
from the temple after Belshazzar’s feast? 
Cyrus restored the Jewish community 
in the Holy Land, and undoubtedly 
many of the Temple treasures were also 
taken back there. However, the profana-
tion of the vessels could have rendered 
them unusable in the eyes of the Jewish 
priests. In this case, they may have been 
left behind, somewhere in the Middle 
East, where they still remain. Perhaps 
the profanation has transformed them 
into Infernal objects, which even now 
are being passed from one owner to the 
next, bringing ruin upon each. Or per-
haps the priests were mistaken, and they 
are in fact holy relics that may bring 
great benefits to those who are judged 
worthy enough to find their resting 
place in the ruins of Babylon.

and his followers were forced to emigrate 
to Medina in 622, from which he fought 
and defeated the Meccans in a war lasting 
eight years. In 630 Mecca submitted to 
Muhammad’s authority, and he confirmed 
the Ka’ba’s importance to Islam as a shrine 
originally constructed by the angels, then 
rebuilt by Adam and later by Abraham with 
the help of his son Ishmael, the ancestor of 
the Arabs. Meanwhile, Islam was spreading 
across the Arabian Peninsula, and by Mu-
hammad’s death in 632 most of the inhabi-
tants of the region were Muslims.
The Caliphates
Muhammad was succeeded as leader 
of the Muslim community by a sequence 
of rulers known as khalifas (kha-LEE-faz), 
or caliphs, “successors to the Prophet” who 
were both the religious and secular leaders 
of the Muslim state, though none claimed 
to be prophets themselves. The first four 
caliphs were chosen by general consensus 
of the community, but the last of these, ‘Ali 
ibn Abi Talib (r. 656-661), spent his entire 
reign fighting against enemies within the 
Muslim community, eventually losing his 
life to a political opponent with a poisoned 
blade. He was succeeded as caliph by the 
leader of his enemies, Mu’awiya ibn Abi Su-
fyan (r. 661-680), who set up a dynastic ca-
liphate, known as the Umayyad (um-MY-
yad) caliphate, with its capital at Damascus.
The Umayyads ruled from Damascus 
for nearly a century, and during this pe-
riod the Muslim world expanded through 
a mixture of force and diplomacy to its 
greatest extent, stretching from North Af-
rica and Spain in the west to the border-
lands of Central Asia and India in the east. 
The Umayyads also set up many of the ad-
ministrative, cultural, and social structures 
of the Muslim world. Arabic became the 
language of the administration, a uniform 
coinage was established, and scholars be-
gan to debate issues of law and theology.
However, the Umayyads were not un-
opposed. The supporters of ‘Ali continued 
to assert the claims of his descendants to 
the caliphate, through ‘Ali’s bloodline as 
cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. 
They gradually divided into a number of 
groups collectively known as the Shi‘a 
((SHEE-’ah), sing/adj. Shi‘i), a process that 
would continue in the centuries that fol-
lowed (for more on Shi‘ism, see Realms of 
Power: The Divine, pages 112-113). A num-
ber of these Shi‘i groups were sources of 
rebellions against the Umayyads, and the 
latter also faced opposition from others 
who felt that they were impious and ille-
gitimate rulers. The culmination of this op-
position came in 750, when the Umayyads 
were displaced by a family descended from 
an uncle of the Prophet, known as the ‘Ab-
basids ((‘ab-BEH-sidz), r. 750-the present).
The ‘Abbasids built a new capital in 
Iraq, called Baghdad, which became a 
prosperous center of a flourishing Muslim 
world. This was the golden age of the Is-
lamic world, when great advances began 
to be made in science, literature, and the-
ology, while the caliphs sent embassies to 
the corners of the world. It was the time 
of caliphs such as the legendary Harun al-
Rashid (r. 786-809), who periodically ven-
tured out by night into the streets of Bagh-
dad in disguise to mingle with his subjects, 
rewarding the good and punishing the bad, 
and is also known for having exchanged 
embassies with Charlemagne himself. In 
the meantime, increasing numbers of the 
caliph’s subjects were converting to Islam, 
though it would take another three or four 
hundred years before Muslims would form 
the overall majority in their lands.
The golden age could not last, and 
from the mid-ninth century ‘Abbasid 
power began to decline. The caliphs faced 
increasing rebellions by Shi‘a and others,

The Cradle & The Crescent
financial problems, and greater difficulty 
in controlling their subordinates. Over 
the next hundred years, the Muslim world 
fragmented, with the various provinces 
becoming largely autonomous states that 
coexisted or warred with one another as 
suited their ambitions. In 945 the caliphs 
came firmly under the control of their 
immediate deputies, a situation that re-
mained broadly the same until the mid-
twelfth century. The Seljuk Turks, lead 
by Togrul Beg, invaded from the Great 
Steppe in 1037, and had gained control of 
the Mythic Middle East by the mid-11th 
century, relegating the caliph to a figure-
head while the Seljuk Turks commanded 
the ‘Abbasid armies and provinces. By 
1157 the caliph had regained enough 
power to drive the Seljuk sultan out of 
Baghdad, and an uneasy truce between the 
religious and secular rulers was instituted 
that remains to this day.
The decline in fortunes of the Seljuks 
was accelerated by the rebellion of the 
Shansabani in 1149, and the uprising of 
the Ghuzz in 1151 in Persia’s eastern prov-
inces. Ala ad-Din Tekish, the leader of Kh-
warazm province, capitalized on the col-
lapse of the Seljuk Empire after the death 
of Sultan Ahmed Sanjar, and eventually 
defeated his successor Togrul III in 1194. 
His son Ala ad-Din Mohammed defeated 
the Shansabani in 1206, and is now the 
ruler of a vast empire that stretches from 
the River Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. 
While he has declared himself shah (Parsi 
“king”), the caliph in Baghdad has yet to 
recognize this claim.
The current caliph, al-Nasir (r. 1180-
1225), is a vigorous ruler, but his realm is 
much reduced, encompassing in reality 
little more than Iraq, though his rule is 
nominally recognized by most of the Sun-
ni (SUN-nee) Muslim provincial rulers.
The Mongol 
Invasion
If your saga follows the course of his-
tory, by the end of the reign of al-Nasir 
the eastern Muslim world has already 
been attacked by the Mongol hordes of 
Genghis Khan (r. 1206-1227), who have 
occupied the region east of the Jaxartes 
River. By Genghis Khan’s death they have 
occupied territory as far west as eastern 
Persia. Subsequently they take western 
Persia, Georgia, Armenia, northern Iraq, 
and Asia Minor. In 1258 they take Bagh-
dad, where they roll the caliph up in a car-
pet and trample him to death, following a 
Mongol custom that forbids the shedding 
of royal blood onto the ground. They are 
only turned back in 1260, when their ad-
vance is checked in Syria by a Mamluk 
army from Egypt. 
Story Seed: The Mongol Threat
The large-scale death and destruc-
tion in Transoxiana may cause mysti-
cal ripples throughout Mythic Europe 
that reach various magi of the Order 
of Hermes. Like the rumored Order of 
Odin in the north, information on the 
nomads is conflicting and incomplete. 
The Primus of Ex Miscellanea is trou-
bled by strange dreams. Dire prophe-
cies are uttered by the seers, astrolo-
gers and other diviners across various 
Houses. The Tremere learn secondhand 
through their network of this potential 
threat to the Order and mobilize their 
intelligence network and resources. 
The Tenens of the East is greatly trou-
bled by the chaos emerging from be-
yond the Levant. Even the normally 
aloof Merinita report an increased tur-
bulence in Arcadia and the discovery of 
new lands and stories emerging within 
the Faerie realm. A strange apparition 
appears during the Great Tribunal at 
Durenmar despite the usual mystical 
defenses prepared for such a momen-
tous meeting.
Details on the Mongol devastation 
of the eastern Islamic lands and rules for 
Mongol shamans are given in the side-
bars of Chapter 9: On the Silk Road.
Story Seed: Disputes over the Caliphate
When the ‘Abbasids overthrew the 
Umayyads, they attempted to wipe 
out as many members of the family as 
possible. They missed at least one who 
went on to found a new ruling dynasty 
in Spain. It may be that they missed 
others, and their descendants may ap-
proach the characters seeking aid in 
gaining the caliphal throne. Likewise, 
the characters could be approached by 
Shi’i claimants to the caliphate for the 
same reason. Some of these claimants 
may have inherited holy relics or other 
powerful supernatural items from their 
forbearers, which may tempt the char-
acters to help them, or they may have 
supernatural powers that make their “re-
quests” difficult to refuse.

Chapter Three
Order of Suleiman
Throughout the years since the found-
ing of the Order of Hermes, magi have 
spoken of the danger that Arabian wizards 
present, calling them “The Order of Sulei-
man” and whispering how they seek to bring 
about the ruin of Hermetic magi. Some 
speculate that these stories were started by 
followers of Flambeau the Founder, or per-
haps by others opposed to the introduction 
of similar wizards in Iberia and elsewhere in 
Europe into House Ex Miscellanea. In any 
case, the idea that an organized group of 
Middle Eastern sorcerers exists and plots 
against them is very common among magi.
They are right.
Of course, this “Order of Suleiman” is 
not exactly what magi fear it is, though it 
does pose a grave threat to those who they 
consider their enemies. It is composed of 
sahirs, usually unGifted Muslim summon-
ers who wield magic spells and devices 
similar to their Hermetic counterparts, 
and who command jinn or other spirits in 
battle. Their animosity toward the Order 
of Hermes is fairly recent, as for most of 
their existence they have been an intro-
verted group, generally devoted to the 
growth of Islamic culture. Since the start 
of the Crusades, however, these powerful 
sorcerers have become more dangerous, 
and have turned their eyes upon Europe.
Sahirs are designed primarily as adver-
saries for magi exploring the Mythic Mid-
dle East, though it is also possible to play 
them as player characters in a saga with a 
Middle Eastern focus.
History
13th-century sahirs believe their pow-
ers originated in the marvels wielded 
by Solomon (Suleiman), King of Israel, 
prophet, and builder of the first temple in 
Jerusalem. It is said he commanded hosts 
of jinn and other spirits, could speak with 
animals and the elements, and possessed 
magical devices that focused his power 
over the supernatural world. Among sahirs, 
tradition holds that the great king learned 
many of these secrets from a mysteri-
ous sage known as Al-Khidr (“The Green 
Man”), a legendary figure who, according 
to the Qur’an, taught Moses, traveled with 
Alexander the Great, and attained immor-
tality by drinking from the Water of Life.
In the years after Solomon many 
claimed to possess his powers, and some 
could indeed summon up spirits and speak 
with beasts as he was said to have done. 
The Art of Solomon did not die out but, 
as the years passed, groups of sorcerers 
began to practice dark and corrupted ver-
sions of his power — some say this Infer-
nal version was initially spread by a pair 
of angels named Harut and Marut tasked 
with this as a test of mankind’s faith — that 
allowed sorcerers to summon and enslave 
spirits to their will. Other traditions de-
veloped educated and more refined forms 
of summoning that allowed them to com-
mand the elements, animals, and nature as 
Solomon was said to have done. In Persia 
especially, this latter version of the Art 
flourished under the influence of Zoroas-
trian priests, who perceived its practice as 
learned and wise.
The birth of Islam changed the Mythic 
Middle East dramatically. Some sahirs be-
lieve that the great caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib, 
friend and son-in-law of Mohammed, also 
received guidance from Al-Khidr. He was 
said to be friendly to magicians and knowl-
edgeable about the natural sciences associ-
ated with the Art of Solomon. Some tales 
describe three wise men who served him, 
travelers from far-off lands whom he met 
on pilgrimage, and who joined his court 
when he became caliph, sworn to support 
his rule and devout in their adherence to 
the teachings of the Prophet. Many of the 
followers of Solomon tell variations on 
this tale to justify their belief that there is 
nothing sinful or worldly about the prac-
tice of magic. As Ali trusted his advisers, 
so too may his holy successors trust the 
wise magicians that succeeded them.
The Umayyad 
Summoners
Some years later, during the Umayyad 
dynasty, another trio of summoners swore 
lifelong service to the caliph; many hold 
that the legend of Ali’s magical advisers 
derives from this event instead. They were 
each given an official title, wazir (“vizier”), 
which at that time meant “bearer of magic 
in service to the caliph.” At first they were 
trusted no more than any other men un-
der his command, and possibly less so by 
those who fought beside them. As the ca-
liphate began to expand its influence into 
Persia, Africa, and Europe, however, the 
warriors began to encounter other magi-
cians — wizards who could rain fire upon 
the armies of Islam, or cause the seas to 
rise up and drown them, or cause the men 
to forget everything they were doing — 
and suddenly the wazirs became especially 
valuable, for the spirits they summoned 
could resist this magic. The foreign wiz-
ards served the armies that opposed the 
caliph, and so it became essential for the 
caliph’s wizards to train others who could 
assist them in the same way.
Soon the three wazirs became thirty 
wazirs, as they sought out and trained 
promising students in their Art, and those

thirty became more than a hundred. Their 
powers developed further as Islam spread, 
so that, in addition to the spirits of the fall-
en, they learned to summon and control 
other spirits such as jinn (see Chapter 4: 
The Jinn), and led waves of them into bat-
tle. With their help, the Umayyad caliphs 
were able to overcome the other wizards 
who opposed them and ensure the safety 
of their troops. Meanwhile, the Umayyad 
armies conquered their foes, and the ca-
liphs came to rule an enormous empire, 
including all of the Middle East and Per-
sia, Northern Africa, Iberia, and even parts 
of France. It is most likely stories of these 
summoners, from before the time of the 
Founding, that magi and other European 
wizards equate with the members of the 
“Order of Suleiman.”
The downfall of the wazirs came from 
their callous dealings with the beings they 
summoned. Their powers essentially al-
lowed them to enslave the jinn who served 
them, even though many of these beings 
also followed the teaching of the Prophet, 
which forbids such treatment. These prac-
tices tainted and ultimately undid their 
holy war, and turned many denizens of the 
supernatural realms against them. By about 
720 AD the wazirs became desperately 
preoccupied defending against attacks 
from within their homelands, fighting a 
magical war waged upon them from other 
worlds. This prevented them from lending 
their support to the invading armies, and 
was one of the leading factors that slowed 
and eventually halted the expansion.
The caliphs were furious at this turn of 
events, but they did not blame their wa-
zirs; instead, they blamed their people. 
Some of the Umayyads’ opponents took 
these attacks as indications that the nation 
of Islam was not rightly guided, and that 
the Umayyads were not true caliphs. A 
few even began to declare rival caliphs. To 
make matters worse, when wrathful spirits 
abused by the wazirs attacked, they fo-
cused upon the summoners themselves, not 
the common people, forcing the caliph-
ate to defend them. For example, in 746, 
while Abbasid opponents of the Umayyads 
were mobilizing their forces in Khurasan, 
it is said that more than a hundred jinn 
laid siege to Damascus, demanding that 
the city turn over two wazirs who they 
knew hid within. After many such retribu-
tive acts, the population of summoners in 
the Mythic Middle East was dramatically 
reduced, and the term wazir ceased to be 
associated with wizards. Their ruthless tra-
dition of summoning mostly died out ev-
erywhere but on the fringes of the empire.
The Formation  
of the Suhhar
As a result of these and other events, 
the Umayyad caliphate broke apart, and a 
new line was established in the Abbasids, 
with their new political center in Baghdad. 
One of the greatest Abbasid leaders was 
Harun al-Rashid, who came to power in 
786. His mother, named Al-Khayzuran, 
was originally from Yemen and skilled in 
the magic of enchanting music and stories. 
At her urging, the new caliph agreed to as-
semble a council of wizards to advise him 
on mystical matters and help him secure 
his rule. He was convinced that having 
magical viziers devoted to the empire was 
a necessary thing, though he preferred to 
recruit great thinkers over great warriors.
The head of this council was his grand 
vizier, Yahya ibn Khalid, also known as 
Yahya the Barmakid, an unGifted scholar 
who had dabbled in magical potions and 
elixirs in the court of the previous ca-
liph, and who served as tutor to Harun 
al-Rashid from a young age. On the new 
caliph’s behalf he wrote to invite the fin-
est minds in Islam to join this “Solomonic” 
council, explaining Harun’s vision of a

The Cradle & The Crescent
magical brotherhood that would make his 
caliphate paramount in learning and cul-
ture. This dream was realized by five great 
men, who with Yahya and Al-Khayzuran 
formed the original “wise council” of Ha-
run. These famous sahirs were:
• Jabir ibn Hayyan, an alchemist, sum-
moner, and scholar blessed with The 
Gentle Gift and a voracious thirst for 
knowledge. He was a master of the 
art called Sihr, first learning at the feet 
of one of the few surviving Umayyad 
summoners, and later studying every-
thing the others knew. He was respon-
sible for the discovery that allowed 
the First Council to incorporate their 
different styles of magic into a single 
tradition.
• Muhammad al-Fazari, philosopher 
and astrologer, collector and author of 
many magical tomes. He constructed 
the first armillary sphere to aid him in 
his seasonal calculations. His father 
Ibrahim is said to have transformed 
himself into a spirit to watch over and 
assist his son with his magic and, as 
al-Fazari’s guardian spirit, Ibrahim first 
showed al-Fazari how to initiate him-
self and the other unGifted sahirs into 
their magical secrets.
• Bakhtyshu, a Persian physician and 
Nestorian Christian. His father, Jurjis 
ibn Bakhtyshu, had served the previ-
ous caliph, but being non-Muslim the 
son was invited to join the council only 
provisionally and at Yahya’s insistence. 
He later proved his worth by exorcis-
ing a powerful shaitan (“demon”) that 
plagued the caliph. It is said he knew 
the True Names of hundreds of spirits, 
and taught many of them to the First 
Council.
• Al-Zill Habib, “the beloved shadow,” a 
popular and inspirational highwayman 
who led revolts against the Umayyads 
and earned the unswerving respect 
of many followers, including a loyal 
band of jinn and several yatus (faerie 
wizards from Persia, see Chapter 8). 
He was believed to be a relative of Al-
Khayzuran, and constantly remained 
cloaked and covered to hide his face, 
even when alone.
• Al-Hajjaj (or Al-Majnun, “the mad-
man,” as he was sometimes called), a 
poet and mathematician who wrote of 
his strange visions. He claimed to have 
studied from Al-Khidr, and to have 
traveled into the Magic Realm to drink 
from the Water of Life. He appeared 
perpetually as a young man of about 
25, and no one could ever determine 
exactly when he was born.
Together, these seven wise people de-
veloped a common language among their 
different styles of summoning-based magic, 
and invented the five Solomonic arts (see 
Solomonic Magic, later). They answered 
directly to the caliph, and as part of their 
duties each of them spent time instructing 
the others or assisting with their magic to 
ensure that they all knew as much as pos-
sible about their different powers. Each of 
them excelled at a particular aspect of the 
Art of Solomon, but they combined these 
specialties so well that their tradition be-
came a unified system, rather than several 
different abilities.
Al-Khayzuran died suddenly in 789 
under very mysterious circumstances. After 
complaining of a headache, she collapsed 
in her sitting room and was escorted, ap-
parently unconscious, back to her cham-
bers. There, under the watchful eyes of her 
son and many of his advisers, her body and 
possessions simply vanished. Her passing 
was mourned by the caliph and the entire 
council. Soon afterward, Yahya retired 
from court to devote himself more fully to 
his studies, and his Gifted son Ja’far became 
Harun’s grand vizier and head of the coun-
cil. Harun moved his palace further north, 
putting more distance between his court 
and the sahirs, and from then on Ja’far was 
the only point of contact between the wiz-
ard council and the caliph.
As Harun’s reputation increased, the 
stories tell that he became more introverted 
and mistrustful of Ja’far and the sahirs he 
represented. He sought out the advice of 
other so-called wise men, including a young 
Hermetic magus sent (supposedly) by the 
court of Charlemagne called Christopher 
Coronus, a famous Sufi teacher and holy 
man named Fozail-e Iyaz, and a strange 
miracle-worker and representative from the 
far east who they called Dawud al-Kharita. 
Under their influence, it is said, Harun be-
gan to resent the independence and power 
wielded by the grand vizier and his family. 
He ceased consulting with Ja’far in private, 
but often did so with his new counselors.
Vicious rumors began to spread about 
Ja’far: that he was a wicked sorcerer who 
consorted with evil spirits, and that he 
craved the caliph’s seat for himself. Ja’far 
begged Harun’s sister, whom he loved, to 
speak with her brother on his behalf, in 
the hope that her voice would soften his 
heart — but when she did, the easterner 
Dawud accused Ja’far of beguiling the lady 
with his magic, and as punishment the ca-
liph had Ja’far executed and the rest of his 
family imprisoned or killed.
Another version of these events is less 
sympathetic to Ja’far: as one of the first 
students of the new Art of Solomon, Ja’far 
was incredibly skilled and powerful, but 
too ambitious to be worthy of the title of 
grand vizier. He was not happy merely 
advising the caliph, and tried to force Ha-
run to adopt him as his heir. The caliph 
proved surprisingly resistant to Ja’far’s en-
chantments, and so the crafty sahir took 
control of the caliph’s sister instead, plot-
ting to gain his seat by marriage. Yahya 
suspected his son, but did not realize how 
far he would go, and it was only because of 
the fortuitous intervention of Harun’s oth-
er advisers that Ja’far’s designs were foiled.
Because of this sudden turn of events, 
the five remaining leaders of Solomonic 
magic became very frightened, and un-
sure of what to do. It seemed their council 
ties to court and caliph had been severed. 
Months passed and there was no word of 
a new grand vizier being appointed, and 
they worried that their alliance would fall 
apart, their great achievements lost. They 
decided to travel in secret to the prison 
where Yahya (who had been mercifully 
spared by the caliph) was held captive, and 
met with him to discuss how they could 
keep the wise council from collapsing.
At Yahya’s urging, they decided that 
they must form their own organization, 
one independent of the caliph. They real-
ized how dangerously vulnerable to court 
intrigue and political maneuvering they 
were as a group of wizards who served 
Harun and the court directly, and instead 
chose to divorce themselves from magical 
service to the worldly authority, and be-
come a self-governing and somewhat in-
formal alliance of sahirs. They called this 
the Suhhar Sulayman (“Summoners of Solo-

22
The Cradle & The Crescent
mon”), and over the course of several sea-
sons they developed a plan for how they 
could function and ultimately prosper. 
(See Organization, later in this chapter.)
When they had finished their found-
ing document, the former viziers humbly 
presented it to Harun, and begged him for 
his permission. Once he was convinced 
that they were not plotting against him, 
the caliph gave this independent council 
his blessing, provided that the sahirs who 
belonged to it continued to serve him as 
Legends of the First Council
Many sahirs have attempted to learn 
what became of the members of the First 
Council, for completeness or inspiration. 
Most of what survives them is stories and 
legends.
Al-Khayzuran
Al-Khayzuran died, but her memo-
ry haunted the building that had once 
been Harun’s palace. A strong feminine 
presence is often recognized by sahirs 
sensitive to spirits in her chamber, and 
many claim to have been visited by her 
in dreams. Some speculate that the many 
tales about her brought a powerful faerie 
to live in her place, a queen who visits 
sleeping travelers and grants them power 
in exchange for stories.
Yahya ibn Khalid
Yahya the Barmakid was forever 
disgraced by his son’s actions at court, 
though he lived long enough to see the 
foundation of the Suhhar. It is said he 
had a collection of permanent Arcane 
Connections to the other members of 
the First Council, though no one knows 
what became of it when he died. It may 
have been on his person and buried with 
him in Baghdad, or he may have hidden 
it in his house or even his cell. The pris-
on still stands in the city, though it has 
long since been abandoned and has an 
evil reputation.
Jabir ibn Hayyan
Jabir went to Kufa, where he wrote 
many books on the Solomonic arts. He 
was said to have become friends with 
Christopher Coronus, magus and ambas-
sador from the Order of Hermes and the 
court of Charlemagne, though few de-
tails about him survive. Christopher cor-
responded extensively with Tremere the 
Founder, he was especially interested in 
using magic to produce visual art, and he 
once threatened to slay Jabir in a duel but 
later said this had been a misunderstand-
ing. It is probable from their conversations 
that early magi and sahirs heard the first 
accounts of each others’ organizations. 
Legends say that Jabir had a crisis of faith 
later in life, and that he sacrificed all of his 
magic just before he died for the right to 
walk in paradise. This story is controver-
sial, as it suggests that Jabir believed he 
could not both be a faithful Muslim and 
practice magic, an idea that has been hot-
ly debated among sahirs ever since.
Muhammad al-Fazari
Muhammad stayed on as the court 
astrologer for the rest of his life, and also 
wrote several exceptional books con-
cerning his fields of expertise. He is said 
to have drawn a series of prophetic pic-
tures before he died that predicted many 
future events, including the separation 
of the Iberian sahirs and Baghdad’s inva-
sion by Mongols. He had no children, 
though he taught many followers, in-
cluding the great Muhammad ibn Musa 
al-Khwarizmi, who is generally regarded 
as one of the most talented astrologers 
that the Suhhar has ever produced. 
While many believe that al-Fazari did 
not die and instead transformed himself 
into a spirit like his father, no one has yet 
demonstrated publicly that they are able 
to summon him.
Bakhtyshu
Bakhtyshu was the caliph’s personal 
physician, and also helped his son Jabril 
ibn Bakhtyshu establish himself with 
the court, setting him up as Ja’far’s as-
sistant. Jabril weathered the fall of the 
Barmakids from the caliph’s grace (some 
say by betraying his master’s plans to his 
enemies), but the stories also tell that 
Jabril ensured the other members of the 
First Council were praised and admired 
by the caliph, perhaps saving them 
from intrigues that would otherwise 
have doomed the Suhhar. Jabril had a 
large family and many children, and his 
descendants carried the magic of Solo-
mon to the famous House of Healing 
in Gundeshapur. Some have even sug-
gested that one of Jabril’s sons returned 
with Dawud al-Kharita to the far east, 
and there established a line of Christian 
magician-kings who would eventually 
produce the legendary figure known as 
Prester John.
Al-Zill Habib and Al-Hajjaj
Both Al-Zill and Al-Hajjaj remained 
in Baghdad for many years of teaching, 
but sometime in the mid-800s they sud-
denly left without warning, instructing 
their followers not to come after them. 
This came just after a visit from one 
of the caliph’s advisers, the Sufi mys-
tic Fozail-e Iyaz, and sahirs have often 
wondered what passed between them, 
and if their departure was due to his 
interference. It was said the two sahirs 
traveled the length of the entire world 
together, from the Pillars of Hercules 
to the mountains of the Far East, and 
there are many stories of those who 
came upon them and shared a meal with 
them, always a young man dressed all in 
white and his companion hooded and 
wrapped in black. It is even said that the 
two of them still live, and that they ap-
pear no different in the year 1220 than 
they must have looked four hundred 
years ago.

loyal subjects. Several of the first council 
members retained positions at court; per-
haps this is why they continued to call 
themselves “viziers,” and their leader the 
“grand vizier,” at their meetings.
A Golden Age
In the years that followed, the Suh-
har Sulayman flourished, teaching many 
students the secrets of Solomonic magic 
and welcoming other summoners into 
their fold. The house in Baghdad where 
the former council had studied and taught 
magic grew into a grand academy of Solo-
monic learning, called Bayt al-Hikma, and 
old and new sahirs joined them there and 
began to share their knowledge. A golden 
age of magic was born, and sahirs trained 
in the Art of Solomon began to spread 
across Muslim lands, bringing their magic 
to every corner of the empire. The Suhhar’s 
separation from the caliph’s court ensured 
that when the caliphate began to fracture, 
the Suhhar itself remained strong. Large 
communities of sahirs were organized 
around houses for teaching and studying 
magic in Damascus, Gundeshapur, Cairo, 
and Cordoba, and every year the viziers 
from those communities would travel to a 
grand gathering to represent their people.
So many sahirs lived in these great cit-
ies that one vizier could not adequately 
represent them; Cairo, for example, sent 
12 viziers to the gathering of 868, one for 
each house where more than two sahirs 
lived. In an important decision of 889, the 
grand vizier declared that the viziers elect-
ed by each community also represented 
the sahirs who lived alone or in pairs clos-
est to them, and that it was the responsi-
bility of the viziers to seek out their more 
solitary brethren and speak with them be-
fore every gathering as part of their service 
to the Suhhar. Before then, most viziers 
had simply avoided those members of the 
Suhhar who chose to live far from civili-
zation, many of whom had The Gift and 
were thus especially unpleasant to visit.
Cities were the primary centers of 
magical growth and learning for sahirs, as 
the lands of Africa and central Arabia and 
the borders of Islam remained very danger-
ous for summoners. Groups of supernatu-
ral beings still angry at the treatment they 
received from the Umayyads prowled the 
edges of their settlements and vindictively 
struck at any victims they could catch. 
Those sahirs willing to live in magical au-
ras outside of the Dominion had to be pre-
pared to summon powerful guardians to 
protect themselves, or create great magi-
cal wards against such spirits that would 
keep them safe, and so generally did not 
set up in such places permanently.
Perhaps they became fearful of the 
long journey across such hostile lands, but 
the Iberian sahirs began hosting their own 
gatherings in Cordoba in 912. The Bagh-
dad sahirs tried to reconcile with them for 
several years, sending emissaries to dis-
suade them, but by 919 they abandoned 
these attempts and expelled them from 
the Suhhar Sulayman. Their Iberian coun-
cil continued to meet on its own until 925 
when the majority decided to join the Or-
der of Hermes. There has been little con-
tact between the two groups since then.
Also during the mid-900s, the rise of 
the Fatimid caliphate drove many sahirs out 
of Northern Africa and east into Egypt, as 
rumor spread that the caliphs fought with 
the aid of strange Berber wizards that the 
sahirs’ spirits could not defeat. The sahirs 
who had preferred to live on the frontier 
either fled back to more populated lands 
or disappeared and were never heard from 
again. Combined with the defection of the 
Iberian sahirs, this reduced the lands occu-
pied and represented by the Suhhar Sulay-
man to just Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.
The Suhhar during this period was 
powerful, though introspective, and con-
tinued to develop so that by the middle 
of the 11th century, it had become the ad-
vanced magical tradition it is in 1220. For 
the most part, expansionist ideals had been 
subdued and deprecated among the mem-
bers of the Suhhar, and most sahirs simply 
wanted to study their magic in peace. 
This peaceful time was interrupted 
when a prominent sahir named Hasan-i 
Sabbah murdered the grand vizier. This 
assassin belonged to a ruthless religious 
sect called the Nizari Isma’ili, and man-
aged to escape punishment for his crime 
by fleeing to a Persian mountain strong-
hold. There, Hasan proceeded to teach 
others of his faith the secrets of Solomon’s 
Art and essentially created a rival organi-
zation of sahirs that has continued to ha-
rass and trouble the Suhhar ever since (see 
The Nizari Isma’ili State, Chapter 8, for 
more about their history and practices).
There was some occasional contact 
with other magical traditions during this 
time — since the First Council, sahirs had 
been aware of the European organization of 
wizards who called themselves the Order 
of Hermes, and after the Cordoba sahirs 
joined this organization there were many 
who sought to know even more about 
them, particularly how their magic differed 
from that of the Suhhar. They also knew 
about a few Zoroastrian priests still living 
in Persia, a few of whom had become sa-
hirs, though relations between them were 
always strained. On the other hand, after 
driving most of the sahirs out of Northern 
Africa, the Berber wizards did not encroach 
further into the Middle East.
By the end of the 11th century, the 
sahirs had turned completely upon them-
selves, their focus entirely inward, and the 
magical Middle East had become like a 
city in a bottle.
The Crusading Suhhar
The situation changed entirely with 
the Crusades. 
When foreign knights laid siege to 
Antioch and Jerusalem, the Muslim sahirs 
were surprised, shocked, and enraged. A 
few acted to help prevent Tyre’s fall, but 
for the most part the Suhhar was wildly 
unprepared for the attack. They then 
overreacted by electing to take a firmer 
hand over the supernatural politics of the 
region. They sent representatives to meet 
with and spy on the European wizards 
who had come over, and were surprised to 
learn that most of them were immune to 
their Solomonic magic, much in the same 
way that spirits, caliphs, and holy men 
had always been able to resist them. Oth-
ers attacked the invaders, fighting with the 
Muslim armies against the magi, but those 
sahirs who met magi directly in battle 
were quickly defeated, and many of them 
were slain.
The reluctant verdict among the major-
ity of surviving sahirs was that the invaders 
fought with the Divine on their side, that

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Families of Solomon’s Seal
The five great families of Solomonic 
sahirs descend from the five members of 
the First Council who formed the Suh-
har Sulayman, some by blood but most 
by association. Each has become special-
ized in one type of magic, and tends to 
come from a particular region.
Ashab al-Sakhr 
“Followers of the Stone”
Ashab 
al-Sakhr 
(ass-HAWB 
us-
SAKHR) is a family of specialists in Solo-
monic Alchemy who descend from Jabir 
ibn Hayyan, the only Gifted member of 
the First Council. They are affiliated with 
the city of Damascus, the former capital 
city of the Umayyad wazirs and now 
the center of the sahirs’ counter-Crusade 
against the invading magi and soldiers. 
Besides being very unfriendly to Euro-
peans, it is common for Followers of the 
Stone to be especially pious, and non-
Muslims are almost unheard of among 
them. It is perhaps the most “noble” sa-
hir family; its members value personal 
honor very highly, and especially favor 
arms and armor. Many of them choose 
to fight with steel instead of magic — or 
with steel augmented with magic.
Ashab al-Najm 
“Followers of the Star”
In the early days of the Suhhar, Solo-
monic Astrology was especially favored 
by a small group of Zoroastrians who 
converted to Islam and came to Baghdad 
to study magic from Al-Khwarizmi, the 
famous student of Al-Fazari. They later 
established a small academy in Nasibin 
in the north, and other houses entirely 
devoted to their art in many Persian cit-
ies as well. Ashab al-Najm (ass-HAWB 
un-NAJM) is perhaps the most wide-
spread family of sahirs, and also the most 
arcane; they tend to dress and look like 
wizards or, at the very least, wise schol-
ars. A common belief in the family is that 
it is important for them to encourage the 
majestic reputation of magicians, even 
while using magic to serve others, lest 
the people cease to value it.
Ashab al-Yad 
“Followers of the Hand”
The first sahirs who specialized in 
Solomonic Physic were all members of 
the Bakhtyshu family, and took their 
magic with them to Gundeshapur, in 
Persia. There they established a famous 
academy known as the House of Heal-
ing. Most of the first physician sahirs 
were Nestorian Christians, though Mus-
lims, Jews, and pagans have also joined 
their family, and their reputation has 
always been somewhat poor because of 
their ready acceptance of outsiders. This 
means the Ashab al-Yad (ass-HAWB ul-
YAD) family is seen to have something 
of a sinister aspect within the Suhhar — 
they are perceived as sahirs who heal but 
who also harm — and so no one is ever 
quite sure exactly how a Follower of the 
Hand will respond to a given situation.
Ashab al-Qalb 
“Followers of the Heart”
Though the Ashab al-Qalb (ass-
HAWB ul-QALB) family was technically 
established by Al-Zill Habib, his follow-
ers generally regard Al-Khayzuran as 
the family’s matriarch and role model, 
especially since so little is known about 
the “beloved shadow” who taught them. 
Since Al-Zill disappeared, the civic focus 
of Solomonic Storytelling has remained 
in Baghdad, still known as the city of 
a thousand tales, and the grand vizier 
elected to lead the Suhhar has most of-
ten been a Follower of the Heart. They 
are usually very political sahirs, interact-
ing with supernatural creatures like faer-
ies and magical beings more often than 
other sahirs, and only rarely have The 
Gift. Women are much more common 
in this family; the sahira-to-sahir ratio is 
almost one-to-one.
Ashab al-Nahr 
“Followers of the River”
Solomonic Travel was often margin-
alized as a lesser art by early sahirs, as 
few of them understood the power of 
other realms and worlds: not just Faerie 
and the Magic Realm, but also places of 
Divine and Infernal power, and even the 
realms of dreams and death. Two genera-
tions after Al-Hajjaj, a Nabatean traveler 
named Ibn Wahshiyya deciphered many 
secrets about these places from the writ-
ings of the ancient Egyptians, and single-
handedly revitalized the Art. There is a 
great academy in Cairo devoted to the 
study of these mysteries, and it is still 
considered the locus of the Ashab al-Nahr 
(ass-HAWB ul-NAHR) family’s magic. 
Ibn Wahshiyya and Al-Hajjaj both had 
reputations for intense passion and, ulti-
mately, madness, and their followers are 
usually eccentric as well.
Ashab al-Halqa 
“Followers of the Circle”
There are also many sahirs who 
consider themselves specialized in no 
particular art, or who focus on their sum-
moning art rather than the Solomonic 
arts. Before they left the Suhhar, many of 
the sahirs of Cordoba called themselves 
Ashab al-Halqa (ass-HAWB ul-HAL-qa), 
referring to the outside edge of the pen-
tacle that forms the Seal of Solomon. 
This term is still used to describe un-
aligned sahirs, or those who claim to be-
long to none of the great families. Most 
Gifted sahirs and self-taught summoners 
meet these criteria, preferring to remain 
apart from the yearly gatherings, where 
they must be represented by viziers from 
the other families.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Jerusalem was rightfully theirs, and that 
there was nothing they could do. Howev-
er, the leader of one of the five great Solo-
monic families, the Asala al-Sakhr, asserted 
that the invaders had been aided by Infer-
nal powers. A strong anti-crusader pres-
ence developed under his direction, espe-
cially among Syrian viziers and those who 
studied Solomonic Alchemy. The Suhhar 
remained publicly uninvolved, but many 
sahirs began acting against the European 
invaders, signing onto armies to fight them 
directly or teaching other soldiers to sum-
mon and wield Solomonic magic against 
their foes, much like the Umayyad wazirs.
The Suhhar soon relaxed most of 
their strictures concerning fair treatment 
of non-Muslim supernatural beings, and 
agreed that crusading magi of the Order of 
Hermes were enemies of the Muslim peo-
ple, authorizing sahirs to retaliate however 
they felt was just. In the aftermath of the 
First Crusade, sahirs acted mostly in secret, 
uncertain what would happen if they were 
to confront the Hermetic wizards directly. 
They taught magic to important leaders, 
helping them understand how the Art of 
Solomon could assist their cause; they 
manipulated real-world events by taking 
advantage of the geography of the Magic 
Realm, circumventing the enemy to ambush 
them from behind or ransack their camps; 
they interpreted astrological indicators to 
predict unfavorable circumstances for their 
enemies, so that they knew precisely when 
to strike; and generally they confused and 
harried the opposing armies and leaders 
wherever possible. Their involvement en-
sured the recapture of Edessa, and also the 
downfall of the Second Crusade against 
the Muslim states.
There is a tradition among the Suhhar 
whereby an appointed vizier adopts the 
guise of a nameless old wise man, much 
as Al-Khidr is described as doing in the 
Qu’ran, and approaches promising Muslim 
leaders or scholars with an offer to teach 
them magic or assist their causes in other 
ways. This is seen as an honorable way 
for sahirs to involve themselves directly 
in the politics of the region without com-
mitting the Suhhar to their cause, and is 
often called “sending a guide.” When two 
men rose to prominence in the late 1100s, 
Nur ad-Din and Saladin, both were sent 
a guide with an offer of magical aid. Nur 
ad-Din had no wish to join the Suhhar, 
revealing to the ambassador that he had 
already been taught magic by Al-Khidr 
himself. In fact, there was a brief exchange 
of wisdom between the two men, docu-
mented in a famous text now kept safely 
in Baghdad. Saladin refused the guide, no 
explanation given, and the sahirs of the re-
gion were forced to try to aid him without 
his consent.
In 1220, the Suhhar Sulayman is still at 
war with the crusaders occupying the Holy 
Land, including members of the Order 
of Hermes. They still observe the yearly 
gathering at Baghdad, but the conflict is 
rarely discussed. Plans are in motion for a 
retaliatory attack against the Levant, what 
might be considered a Solomonic counter-
crusade, and sahirs have been gathering 
intelligence about the Order of Hermes 
so they may strike at them where they are 
weakest and — they hope — drive the in-
vading magi from their lands entirely.
To this end, the sahirs have made it 
clear that all Hermetic magi are welcome 
in their lands, where they can be watched 
more easily without their knowledge, and 
where they can be found more quickly 
when the time comes to attack. They now 
study their enemy in earnest, for they are 
still at war and do not intend to lose.
Culture
Most of what defines a sahir of the 
Suhhar Sulayman was decided by the 
members of the First Council, codified at 
the meeting in 805 when they first be-
came an independent organization, and 
this has been reinforced at the gathering 
every year since (see Organization, later, 
for details of how these gatherings func-
tion). As they envisioned it, a person must 
simply appear before the assembly accom-
panied by a sponsor to join, and need only 
demonstrate to the assembled sahirs that 
he can summon a spirit. No other criteria 
or restrictions were considered necessary, 
since all of their magic depended on this 
power more than anything else.
In deference to Al-Khayzuran and

The Cradle & The Crescent
Bakhtyshu, no restrictions against women 
or non-Muslims were written into the 
founding document. They required that, 
in addition to the pious practice of zakat, 
every sahir must share one-quarter of his 
wealth with the Suhhar, which would ap-
ply these resources towards the spread of 
knowledge in their communities. Also, 
because of the many jinn uprisings from 
the century before, they established rules 
governing how sahirs could summon and 
interact with spirits. No thinking, feeling 
being would be bound in thrall to a sahir, 
they wrote, or held captive by a sahir who 
himself remained free; those who did this 
would no longer be part of the Suhhar. 
These were the only laws they envisioned 
the sahirs needing to enforce; all other 
matters would be decided by Islamic law, 
to which they were all clearly subject.
In 1220 there are approximately 5,000 
members of the Suhhar living in the lands 
of the Mythic Middle East. They are most 
numerous in Iraq and Jazira, least common 
in Transoxania, and while a small commu-
nity might support only five or six sahirs 
at most, large cities like Al-Mada’in or 
Basra can easily support 50, often divided 
up among different districts. Beyond the 
boundaries of this book’s focus, in Syria 
or Egypt for example, might be found an-
other two or three thousand sahirs who 
also belong to the Suhhar and who send 
representation each year. Of this total, 
about two-thirds are men, three-quarters 
are Muslims, and only about 500 have The 
Gift. In total, sahirs outnumber Hermetic 
magi by about five to one.
Organization
The Suhhar Sulayman is governed by a 
consultative council, the Majlis al-Sulayman 
((MAJ-liss al-SUE-lem-un), “Solomonic 
Council,” pl. Majalis). Every community 
of three or more sahirs living within the 
borders of Islam chooses one of its number 
to represent it as a vizier at the Majlis, and 
this representative travels to Baghdad every 
summer to speak on behalf of the commu-
nity. All these assembled viziers then elect 
one of their own to lead them as grand vi-
zier. Each vizier has one vote in this deci-
sion, no matter how many sahirs he repre-
sents, but the matter is often easily settled 
by the volume of cheers as each candidate 
comes forward, or by a show of hands. A 
strict count of votes is rarely necessary.
Once elected, the grand vizier ad-
dresses all issues that are brought to him, 
though these are typically issues that are 
purely internal to the Suhhar. All the Ma-
jlis ultimately oversees is membership in 
the Suhhar, and thus the worst sentence 
that the grand vizier can pronounce at 
Majlis is expulsion. In this, the grand vi-
zier has absolute authority for the whole 
year, though he is also expected to follow 
precedent and heed the will and advice of 
his fellow viziers. Most issues that come 
up between gatherings are deferred until 
Majlis, since the first thing the new grand 
vizier must do is ratify any judgments that 
have been made since the previous year.
The Suhhar has five distinct “families” 
of sahirs, magical lineages that trace back 
to five of the members of the First Coun-
cil. Each family represents one particular 
branch of the Solomonic art, and the five 
heads of these families are collectively re-
ferred to as the Asalat ((a-sa-LEHT), sing. 
Asala (a-sa-LAH)), which means “points” 
and refers to the five points on the Seal of 
Solomon. Each family has its own method 
of choosing their Asala, but they are usu-
ally the most powerful followers of their 
art. All five must be present for the Majlis 
to be valid; if any of them are missing the 
family must agree upon another Asala be-
fore the grand vizier is chosen.
The five Asalat have the authority to 
remove the grand vizier, and any of them 
may call for a private vote at any time if 
they believe he is unable to guide the Suh-
har with wisdom. They can also choose 
another grand vizier between gatherings, 
if the previous grand vizier is removed 
or something happens to him, and this 
appointment is valid until the next time 
the Majlis meets. This is a rare event, not 
least because it requires all five of them to 
gather and discuss it. For this reason, none 
of the Asalat may be elected grand vizier, 
though they each have a vote.
Only viziers are supposed to attend 
Majlis, though there are three exceptions. 
Sahirs applying to join the Suhhar may at-
tend in the company of a vizier, servants 
of a vizier may attend to see to his needs, 
and spirits that have been summoned by 
the vizier may enter with him but may not 
be summoned while inside without special 
dispensation from the grand vizier. All 
three sorts of guest are expected to be un-
obtrusive, and do not vote. Any attention 
they attract reflects positively or negative-
ly upon the vizier who they accompany, 
and if they disturb the proceedings the 
grand vizier typically orders that vizier to 
leave, taking them with him.
Issues commonly brought to the Majlis 
include: disputes over rights to contested 
resources such as vis or spirits; accusations 
that a sahir is not devoting himself to the 
spread of knowledge as he has promised to 
do; initiating new members into the Suh-
har; declaring former members officially 
removed from the Suhhar; and matters 
of policy or complaints regarding sahirs’ 
dealings with other wizards or supernatu-
ral beings. There are often discussions, 
such as what should be done in hypotheti-
cal situations, or the sharing of knowledge 
or intelligence regarding what is happen-
ing within the borders of Islam.
Established practice at Majlis is for the 
grand vizier to hear all who wish to speak 
to each issue, and these speeches usually 
address how similar matters have been de-
cided previously, or else they are pleas 
for mercy or special consideration due to 
unusual circumstances. The standard pun-
ishment for every crime is expulsion from 
the Suhhar, though the grand vizier can al-
ways declare a less severe punishment if he 
feels it is merited — for example, he can 
lessen a sentence by requiring the offender 
pay a fine of vis (due by the next Majlis) 
or perform a service for the Suhhar in lieu 
of expulsion. Of course, the grand vizier 
risks upsetting the rule of law and being 
removed from his position if he demon-
strates obvious favoritism.
Since the days of the First Council, 
most of the decisions of the Majlis have 
been justice between individuals, and only 
rarely those that would affect the entire 
Suhhar. Those few decisions of precedence 
have mostly governed how representa-
tives speak for the sahirs they represent, 
and what constitutes a community (“three 
or more who live together” is the general 
rule). Other verdicts established the many 
ways that sahirs may fulfill their obligation 
to the spread of knowledge. Sahirs must 
not trouble the Majlis with matters that

27
The Cradle & The Crescent
can be addressed by the mundane court 
unless there are supernatural factors that 
only sahirs would recognize, and then it is 
usually better that other sahirs speak with 
the court on their behalf.
The fact that only viziers may attend 
and speak at the Majlis, and that sahirs 
are usually not inclined to choose trouble-
makers as their representatives, means that 
it is common for a sahir accused at the Ma-
jlis to be unable to even attend, much less 
speak in his own defense. This is accepted 
as normal, and a sahir’s vizier provides 
such defense as he feels appropriate. Ob-
viously, things often go badly for sahirs on 
bad terms with their vizier, but this is an-
other reason for using the mundane courts 
to resolve most problems.
It is not uncommon for two aggrieved 
parties, or the viziers representing them, 
to duel rather than rely on the judgment of 
the grand vizier. There are many kinds of 
trials acceptable to the Majlis, from boast-
ing contests and competitive storytelling 
to spirit champions wrestling each other 
for dominance — even duels to the death 
using magic, steel, or both. For this to serve 
justice, both parties must agree to abide by 
the results of the duel (although if a sahir 
is obviously more powerful than his chal-
lenger, it is considered cowardly not to ac-
cept), and the terms must be acceptable to 
both parties and the grand vizier. Gener-
ally, seconds decide the specifics, based on 
what they know of the competitors, and 
these events are often seen as a form of en-
tertainment for the assembled viziers.
An important issue settled by the Ma-
jlis concerns sahirs who become super-
natural beings (who, in mechanical terms, 
gain a Might Score). In the 10th century, a 
sahir complained that another had learned 
to summon him with his magic, and had 
shared this formula with several of his co-
horts, who would all constantly interrupt 
his studies by summoning him and pro-
posing absurd bargains. The second sahir, 
who had guessed this was coming and got 
his companions to elect him their vizier, 
argued that there was no law forbidding 
him from practicing the Art on any spirit 
he could summon. After much discussion, 
the grand vizier ruled that since the first 
sahir could be summoned by the second, 
he was no longer a sahir. As a supernatu-
ral being, the (former) sahir was no longer 
subject to their laws, and could do what-
ever he wished to the other as recompense 
for being annoyed by him and his friends. 
Since then, the Suhhar has treated all spir-
its and other supernatural creatures as in-
eligible for membership.
The Suhhar requires that sahirs only 
give or sell “magic things” that they have 
made to other sahirs. This was originally 
agreed to ensure that sahirs did not anger 
the caliph by supplying magical devices to 
his enemies, but is now used to help pre-
vent bound spirits and Solomonic magic 
from being used against the Suhhar, and 
also to keep rival groups from forming in 
the Middle East by limiting their access 
to vis. Offering vis to spirits that sahirs 
have summoned is perfectly acceptable, 
but sahirs are not supposed to trade away 
extracted vis to magi or other wizards in 
the region (trading naturally-occurring vis 
is still a gray area, and of course sahirs can 
buy vis with impunity). Also, sahirs are 
required to retain control of any magical 
devices that they make for non-sahirs to 
use. This restriction includes mundane ob-
Majlis Story Seeds
There are many stories centered 
around the Majlis al-Sulayman, for sagas 
focused on sahirs or magi.
A New Grand Vizier
Kha’trazh appears to be in his fifties, 
though he has lived almost a hundred 
years. Many think he is likely to die 
soon, which will cause great delibera-
tion at the next Majlis as the assembled 
sahirs try to choose an appropriate re-
placement. When this happens between 
gatherings, the Asalat usually choose the 
vizier who represents the original bayt 
al-hikma (now called the Dar al-Hikma, 
see Chapter 7: Mesopotamia, Baghdad) 
to serve in the interim, but the sahir who 
currently holds that position is very 
controversial and unlikely to retain the 
position after the vote. Campaigning for 
the position will likely proceed in ear-
nest as soon as Kha’trazh dies.
A Test of Arms
The Followers of the Stone typi-
cally decide their Asala with a test of 
arms, and a vengeful sahir who opposes 
Kha’trazh might challenge his family’s 
leader to try to take the position.
The Sixth Asalat
A group of sahirs who do not be-
long to the five families insist they re-
ceive representation among the Asalat, 
and demand a sixth Asala. Sahirs who 
belong to this movement might use a 
six-pointed star as their symbol.
The Sahir-Magus
A magus who can summon spirits 
could easily gain membership in the 
Suhhar Sulayman, and perhaps speak 
on behalf of his sodales in the Order of 
Hermes. This might make Kha’trazh’s 
policy of avoiding immediate conflict 
with the Order of Hermes unfeasible, 
and to resolve the situation he might 
quietly encourage other sahirs to chal-
lenge this sahir-magus to a duel.
The Sahirs of Iberia
An Iberian sahir comes to Majlis, 
representing a community of sahirs that 
do not belong to the Order of Hermes. 
He reminds them that another Crusade 
threatens the followers of Islam — the 
Reconquista — and begs them to con-
sider restoring their alliance.
The Vizier’s Opposition
Kha’trazh expels a popular sahir ac-
cused of betraying the Suhhar. This is a 
rallying point for the leader of the grand 
vizier’s opposition, who promises to re-
store the disgraced sahir if his support-
ers will vote for him.

The Cradle & The Crescent
jects that have been improved with Solo-
monic magic, like weapons or animals, and 
has recently been applied to books writ-
ten about Solomonic magic. Sahirs caught 
letting enhanced items loose must forfeit 
whatever payment they received, and are 
usually tasked by the grand vizier with re-
covering the enhanced items for the Suh-
har in lieu of expulsion.
Another issue that has been settled 
by precedent is who may participate in 
the vote for grand vizier, and who settles 
disputes regarding the outcome. In order 
to attend the Majlis, every sahir must be 
vouched for by an Asala, who introduces 
him to the assembly and names the com-
munity he represents. If no Asala will 
speak for him, he may not enter. If there 
is a dispute regarding the outcome of the 
vote, the Asalat settle the matter. Once 
when there was a tie for grand vizier, the 
Asalat voted to determine the winner. An-
other time when the former grand vizier 
was delayed until past dusk and the as-
sembled viziers had proceeded to choose 
another grand vizier without him, the 
Asalat decided to reverse the decision and 
vote again.
For nearly 30 years, the Majlis has 
chosen Kha’trazh al-Wazir al-Dall Ariq al-
Qalb to lead them, a calm and quiet man 
from Basra who always chooses his words 
carefully. He is not considered especially 
clever or powerful — he does not have 
The Gift — and he is said to have cho-
sen his laqab name al-Wazir al-Dall (“the 
dignified vizier”) to suggest that he would 
not abuse his position or give himself airs. 
His chief virtues are that he is thought to 
be easily guided by the voices of his as-
sembled viziers, that he listens to every-
one who wishes to speak, and that he is on 
relatively good terms with all five Asalat.
The Majlis has always been a festive 
occasion, but in the years since the start 
of the Crusades, the tone of the gathering 
has become more solemn. Sahirs know 
that a powerful enemy has invaded, one 
who can probably infiltrate their gather-
ings and divine their movements. Thus, 
they are careful not to wage war overtly, 
and their plans are not discussed in public. 
The official word is that the Majlis has no 
authority over non-Solomonic wizards, 
and so matters dealing with them are off 
the table. Those sahirs who have encoun-
tered the enemy are usually invited to 
Majlis in Baghdad
Every summer, many of the streets 
and much of the open land on the south 
side of the Round City in Baghdad (see 
Chapter 7) fill with stalls and tents in an 
enormous fair. This is attended by mer-
chants from all over the Mythic Middle 
East, and lasts most of the season. All 
manner of goods and services may be 
found at this event, including unique 
items and entertainments brought by 
strange men from fantastic lands. Visitors 
are cautioned to maintain a clear idea of 
what they seek before they explore, for 
there are many vendors who appear only 
when their wares are especially desired, 
or who lure unwary travelers into their 
tents where they disappear forever.
The Suhhar Sulayman meets here 
every year in a great six-sided hall lo-
cated at the center of the bazaar and 
hidden from outsiders with powerful 
magic, so that it appears as a collection 
of brightly-colored tents always in the 
distance. It is usually guarded by several 
powerful spirits summoned by the Asalat 
to keep outsiders from intruding. Inside 
the hall is a series of luxurious tiers sev-
eral levels deep, outfitted with sumptu-
ous pillows, lamps, fans, and magically-
conjured servants that bring food and 
drink, all of this beneath a transparent 
ceiling that shows the sky and the heav-
ens beyond. The six descending steps 
of comfort where the viziers assemble 
by family surround a central stage with 
a gold-inlaid pentacle, where the grand 
vizier sits on a jeweled throne.
The official dates of the Majlis al-
Sulayman are always carefully calcu-
lated by the astrologers of the Suhhar to 
match the dates of the First Council. It 
is supposed to begin at dusk on the day 
when the sun passes from the constella-
tion of Leo into the sign of Virgo, and 
it continues through the following night, 
typically breaking up before dusk on the 
third day. (In 1220 AD, this is August 15-
17.) In unusual circumstances the Majlis 
can continue beyond these dates, but the 
majority of the viziers will likely depart, 
their obligation having been fulfilled.
If re-elected, the current grand vi-
zier Kha’trazh holds formal council the 
first evening and late into the night, and 
all the next day as well, though he does 
not expect the other viziers to endure 
his strict regimen, and does not appear 
to notice if anyone naps through the 
proceedings. He usually reserves more 
controversial matters for the second eve-
ning after dinner. Viziers are encouraged 
to mingle, for once the grand vizier has 
been elected their official role is done, 
though Kha’trazh listens patiently to any 
vizier who wishes to speak. The contem-
porary Majlis is usually a quiet buzz of 
many different voices speaking together, 
surrounding the louder and more formal 
speeches in the central circle. Another 
grand vizier might organize the event 
differently, as others have in the past.
Many sahirs come to this event to 
trade vis with each other outside in the 
market. Some types of vis are particu-
larly valuable to them (what magi would 
identify as Rego vis), and some are not 
(they generally have little use for Animal 
and Herbam vis). Magi who come upon 
the bazaar may be surprised at the num-
ber of supernatural curiosities available 
for barter.
Once the Majlis is over and summer 
has turned to autumn, the south side of 
the old city of Baghdad empties and the 
collection of paths, lots and stalls soon 
looks like a jumble of ruins again. The lo-
cal sahirs maintain this illusion of dilapi-
dated abandonment, to prevent passersby 
from stumbling upon their buildings or 
other evidence of the yearly gathering. A 
few of the vendors do remain throughout 
the year, though they tend to be “in the 
know” since the district does not have a 
good reputation with the rest of Baghdad 
and most of its people look to other mar-
kets for their needs.

The Cradle & The Crescent
meet privately with the grand vizier in a 
magical fortress on an island hidden deep 
within the Magic Realm, where such mat-
ters can be discussed more openly.
How Sahirs Live
Sahirs are typically organized around 
buyut al-hikma, which are run by the vi-
ziers of the Suhhar. Their primary purpose 
is teaching the Art of Solomon to other sa-
hirs and initiating promising students into 
their secrets. Their secondary purpose is 
educating their community and providing 
a center for higher learning and culture. 
Most cities in the Middle East have a bayt 
al-hikma located somewhere within their 
walls, and some (like Baghdad or Najaf) 
have several.
Buyut al-hikma typically have a li-
brary (made up of books donated in ex-
change for access), Solomonic laborato-
ries, and vis stores. They are similar to 
Hermetic covenants, and can be designed 
in much the same way. Unlike Hermetic 
covenants, however, buyut do not typi-
cally have an income that can support 
more than the sahirs who live and work 
there, since they must also provide service 
to their community. Buyut are generally 
welcoming to strangers, since sahirs are, 
at least in theory, obliged to share their 
knowledge with anyone who has an inter-
est. Teachers at buyut occasionally find 
themselves instructing young students 
alongside master sahirs.
Many sahirs may live within buyut 
al-hikma, while others merely live nearby 
and visit them regularly. A few sahirs, es-
pecially those with The Gift, live on their 
own far from large groups of people, and 
communicate with other sahirs through 
written messages or other means. Every 
sahir must maintain ties with his bayt, be-
cause it is his only connection to the Suh-
har as a whole. If a vizier has been unable 
to make contact with a sahir for five years, 
he is considered lost. Others may be sent 
to try to find him, or may not, depending 
on the opinion his vizier has of him, but if 
a lost sahir returns, he may always go to 
Majlis with his vizier and ask to rejoin.
Like most scholars in the Mythic 
Middle East, sahirs must support them-
selves, typically by working two seasons 
out of every year. If a sahir lives at a bayt 
al-hikma, these two seasons include the 
season of service required by the Suhhar. 
Many sahirs teach, instructing other sahirs 
or students in the Solomonic arts or other 
subjects as directed by the community’s 
leaders. Others are scribes, apothecaries, 
or physicians, though other professions 
are possible too.
For those sahirs who are uncomfort-
able working among others, or unable 
to do so, the donation of one-quarter of 
their wealth is considered an acceptable 
substitute for service. Each sahir gives his 
contribution to his vizier, who uses it to 
subsidize the bayt or fund special projects 
requested by the grand vizier.
Most new sahirs learn magic from oth-
er sahirs, though a few are discovered with 
summoning powers and invited to initiate 
the Solomonic arts with aid from their 
mentors. When brought before the Majlis 
and recognized as a new member, a sahir 
typically takes a new name by which he 
will be known from then on. This is often 
a unique collection of sounds that the sa-
hir likes, or perhaps a name taken to honor 
someone he admires, similar to the Mus-
lim ism. He typically adds a nisba to the end 
of his name as well, to represent his Solo-
monic family: al-Sakhr, al-Najm, al-Yad, 
al-Qalb, al-Nahr, or very rarely al-Halqa 
(see The Families of Solomon’s Seal). If a 
sahir is chosen by his community to speak 
for them, he typically takes another name, 
a laqab that describes how he intends to 
represent them. This nickname is only 
used as long as he fulfills this role; if he 
steps down or his community appoints an-
other, the laqab is dropped.
Characters

ing sahir characters to play in a saga, ei-

The Cradle & The Crescent
Sahir Virtues and Flaws
Some of these Virtues refer to Accelerat-
ed Supernatural Abilities. These are like oth-
er Supernatural Abilities, but they increase 
on the same accelerated scale as Hermetic 
Arts, and are described in more detail under 
The Solomonic Arts, later in this chapter.
There are many Hermetic Virtues and 
Flaws that might be appropriate for sahirs 
to take as Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as 
long as they improve or limit Solomonic 
magic to the same degree. Storyguides are 
encouraged to adapt these as they see fit.
New and Modified Virtues
The following Virtues are appropriate 
to sahir characters.
Invocation of Names of Power
Major, Supernatural
The sahir is capable of casting a unique 
type of spell called a Name of Power, which 
is invented like a summoning spell (see Sea-
sonal Summoning, later in this chapter) 
but grants a bonus to a subsequently cast 
spell, similar in scope to those found on the 
Shape and Material Bonus table. The spell 
level is equal to five times the bonus; some 
example Names of Power are given in the 
nearby insert. If the sahir knows a Name 
of Power that governs the area of another 
spell he wishes to cast, he may “utter” (cast) 
the Name of Power first, and the subse-
quent spell’s Casting Total receives a bonus 
equal to that of the Name of Power. Thus, a 
Name of Power: Shamash can give a bonus 
to any formula involving light or justice. A 
sahir may utter any number of applicable 
Names of Power before casting a spell, but 
the total bonus cannot exceed his Finesse 
score. Names of Power can also be used in 
conjunction with summoning; the Names 
invoked must match the type of spirit being 
summoned. Some examples are:
Name	
Type
Adad	
storms, divination
Dumuzi	
livestock, crops
Ishtar	
healing, love
Nergal	
destruction, disease
Ninhursag	
earth
Shamash	
light, justice
For example, Jasmin knows the Name of Pow-
er: Ishtar at Level 20, granting her +4 to healing 
effects. She utters this formula in the round before a 
Solomonic Physic formula designed to speed recov-
ery, and receives a +4 bonus to her Casting Total. 
Jasmin also knows a Level 15 Name of Power: Ni-
nhursag that gives +3 to earth-related effects, and 
a Level 15 Name of Power: Nergal that gives +3 to 
destruction-related effects. She wants to summon an 
earthquake spirit, so takes two rounds to utter both; 
however, since her Finesse is 5, she receives only +5 
to her roll to summon the spirit, rather than +6.
Botching a Name of Power roll, or a 
spell affected by a Name of Power, usu-
ally attracts the negative attention of the 
Named being. This Virtue is similar to 
(and possibly the ancestor of) the Invoca-
tion Magic Virtue (The Mysteries Revised Edi-
tion, page 78).
The yatus (see Persia, Chapter 8) in-
troduced this Virtue into the Suhhar Su-
layman, and they usually call upon the 
names of the ancient Mesopotamian gods 
(see Mythic Mesopotamia, Chapter 7).
Sahir
Free, Social Status
By demonstrating to the Majlis that 
he can summon a spirit, the character has 
been accepted into the Suhhar and is af-
filiated with a magical academy known as 
a bayt al-hikma, or “house of wisdom.” He 
is obliged to further the Suhhar’s causes for 
one season every year, but is supported by 
them and benefits from increased access to 
its teachers, books, and vis sources. During 
character creation, the character may take 
appropriate Academic or Arcane Abilities.
If the character does not actually pos-
sess the power to summon a spirit, he 
should take the Dark Secret Story Flaw, as 
he will be immediately expelled from the 
Suhhar when this fact is discovered.
This Virtue should be taken along 
with another Social Status Virtue or Flaw, 
to describe the character’s status among 
non-sahirs.
Sihr
Major, Supernatural
This Virtue gives the character an ini-
tial score of 0 in the Accelerated Super-
natural Ability of (Solomonic) Sihr.
Solomonic Alchemy
Major, Supernatural
The character gains an Accelerated 
Supernatural Ability, Solomonic Alchemy, 
with an initial score of 0.
Solomonic Astrology
Major, Supernatural
Taking this Virtue gives the character 
the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of 
Solomonic Astrology with an initial score 
of 0.
Solomonic Physic
Major, Supernatural
Taking this Virtue gives the character 
the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of Sol-
omonic Physic with an initial score of 0.
Solomonic Storytelling
Major, Supernatural
Taking this Virtue gives the character the 
Accelerated Supernatural Ability Solomonic 
Storytelling with an initial score of 0.
Solomonic Travel
Major, Supernatural
The character gains an initial score of 
0 in the Accelerated Supernatural Ability 
of Solomonic Travel.
Vizier
Minor, Social Status
The character has been elected as 
representative for a community of sahirs. 
This gives him several political advan-
tages, such as the ability to attend Majlis 
and speak before the grand vizier, as well 
as additional responsibilities at his bayt al-
hikma. The character has a Reputation of 
level 3 among the Suhhar, which can be 
positive or negative.
Only characters with the Sahir Virtue 
may take this Virtue.
Yatu Magic
Minor, Supernatural
The sahir’s heritage comes from the 
yatus of Persia (see Mazandaran, Chap-
ter 8). He is attuned to both Magic and 


--- Page ---

31
The Cradle & The Crescent
Faerie auras, and his magical effects can 
be treated as either Magic or Faerie pow-
ers, depending upon which gives him the 
most favorable (or least unfavorable) aura 
bonus. He does not gain Warping Points 
from living in either type of aura.
New and Modified Flaws
These Flaws are also designed espe-
cially for sahir characters.
Bound Spells
Major, Supernatural
All of the sahir’s spells are bound to a 
specific spirit when they are invented, the 
spirit that was present in the laboratory to 
power the effect. Unlike other sahirs, the 
character cannot cast his spells through 
any spirit he summons, but must use the 
spirit to which the spell is bound. The 
sahir may easily reinvent a spell in one 
season that he has learned to cast with an-
other spirit, since he effectively possesses 
a lab text for that spell.
Patron
Minor or Major, Story
The character serves an important fig-
ure in the Mythic Middle East, such as the 
caliph, a wealthy emir, an ancient jinni, or 
a powerful sahir. This person will periodi-
cally instruct the character to act on his 
behalf — the more powerful the patron, 
the more onerous or frequent the duties 
that will be required of the character. As a 
Minor Flaw, the character has the patron’s 
ear, and may influence him and his requests. 
Also, the patron will generally grant a fa-
vor or boon to the character whenever he 
does something that is asked of him. As a 
Major Flaw, the character has little choice 
in the matter and must do whatever his 
patron asks, or suffer grave consequences. 
Rewards are not to be expected.
(Realm) Spirit Companion
Minor, Story
The character is accompanied by an 
intelligent magical spirit companion, one 
that is smart enough to follow orders, and 
also to disobey them. The greater the 
companion’s Might Score, the more inde-
pendent it is. A grog-level spirit (Might 
Score of about 5 or less) is nearly an exten-
sion of the character’s will, while a com-
panion-level spirit (Might Score of about 
10) will follow instructions but often do 
what it thinks is best, and a magus-level 
character (Might Score of 15 or more) is 
condescending or wild, and rarely acts ex-
cept on its own initiative.
The spirit may belong to any realm. If 
it is infernal, this is a Major Story Flaw in-
stead, as the demon regularly attempts to 
corrupt the sahir. An infernal Spirit Com-
panion in the Mythic Middle East is not 
as bad as it would be in Mythic Europe, 
as other sahirs will assume that the sahir 
has it under control, though they might be 
more wary in its presence.
Sahir Character Creation
Designing sahirs is slightly different 
from making magi, as the majority of sa-
hirs do not have The Gift and are more 
like companions in terms of power. Sahirs 
do not have an established apprentice-
ship period, so their seasonal experience 
gained during character creation is stream-
lined, and since sahirs manage their own 
Other Summoning Arts
There are four summoning powers 
published in other Ars Magica supple-
ments that may be used with Solomonic 
magic, since all can target spirits and 
originate from the Art of Solomon. 
These are listed in order of rarity in the 
Middle East, from most to least, with 
their variations are summarized as fol-
lows. To help distinguish them, differ-
ent versions of Summoning often have a 
parenthetical in front of the name, sug-
gesting their particular focus.
(Spirit) Summoning
This Art summons any incorporeal 
spirit, generally one associated with the 
same realm as this Art, though Infernal 
spirits are also common. If the summon-
ing is successful, the spirit is bound un-
til released by the summoner. (Spirit) 
Summoning is always tainted with the 
Infernal, and thus Infernal versions are 
most common, but there are also Faerie 
and Magic versions. (Realms of Power: The 
Infernal, pages 114-115)
(Theurgical) Summoning,  
or (Elemental) Summoning
Some of this magical tradition’s 
followers summon spirits associated 
with the elemental forms (Aquam, Au-
ram, Ignem, or Terram). The spirit can 
come from any realm, and is typically 
held within a container until released. 
The power is most commonly Magic, 
though other realms are possible. It is 
relatively common in Persia and Asia 
Minor. (Hedge Magic Revised Edition, pages 
23-24)
(Exotic) Sihr,  
or (Jinni) Summoning
Like Solomonic Sihr, this Iberian 
version of the Art can summon and 
bind a jinni, if the sahir can overpower 
it with his Summoning Total. It is not 
very common in the Mythic Middle 
East, since its Solomonic counterpart is 
so widespread. (Houses of Hermes: Societates, 
pages 135-136)
(Realm) Summoning,  
or (Faerie) Summoning
This is a rare Summoning vari-
ant targeting creatures from a single 
realm, and so can potentially summon 
Divine, Faerie, Magic, or Infernal spir-
its. Currently the only known version 
summons faeries (Realms of Power: Faerie, 
pages 131-132), and is found among the 
yatus of Persia and occasional travelers 
from Europe, though there are also ru-
mors of a far eastern version aligned to 
the Divine.

The Cradle & The Crescent
incomes rather than depending on a cov-
enant, the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw 
have a much greater impact.
Gifted sahirs should occupy the same 
status as magi. With the troupe’s approval, 
unGifted sahirs may be Mythic Compan-
ions, with twice as many points of Virtues 
as Flaws and a free Minor Virtue, and tak-
ing the place of a magus character. Un-
Gifted sahirs can also be played as regular 
companions with the normal amount of 
Virtues and Flaws.
Virtues and Flaws
Every sahir accepted into the Suh-
har Sulayman takes the Free Sahir Social 
Status Virtue. Unless he takes the Dark 
Secret Flaw, he should have the Sihr Vir-
tue or another Virtue or Virtues that al-
low him to summon spirits. For example, 
a Kurdish group of sorcerers called the 
Mulhidun in northern Persia (see Realms 
of Power: The Infernal, pages 136-137) 
have (Spirit) Summoning, and many of 
them have joined the Suhhar. There are 
also two societies of elemental wizards 
found throughout the region, called the 
Brethren of Purity and the Students of 
Avicenna (see Hedge Magic Revised Edition, 
pages 28–32), and a few of them might 
have a special elementalist summoning 
art (Theurgical Summoning) and one or 
more Elementalist Abilities (e.g., Elemen-
talist Fire) that can be used in conjunction 
to summon an elemental spirit.
A sahir with The Gift and a summon-
ing Virtue or Virtues may begin play after 
having been initiated into the tradition 
by another Gifted sahir, with all five of 
his Solomonic arts opened at 0. He also 
receives a Minor Virtue at no cost to rep-
resent his teacher’s influence: usually Puis-
sant (Ability) in the Solomonic art associ-
ated with the master’s family.
Many sahirs are Educated (see Intro-
duction, Chapter 1) or have Arcane Lore 
or the Student of Magic Virtue to repre-
sent their studies with their mentors. A 
few sahirs learn their magic from spirits 
directly, and the Ghostly Warder Virtue is 
one way to represent this advantage.
Like other characters unaffiliated with 
a Hermetic covenant, sahirs must spend 
time every year working to support them-
selves (this includes their yearly obliga-
tion to the Suhhar). For most sahirs, this 
takes two seasons every year. Characters 
with the Wealthy Virtue lose only one sea-
son a year, and those with the Poor Flaw 
are free only one season each year. The 
difference between these two extremes 
is especially noticeable during character 
creation; a rich sahir will be many mag-
nitudes more powerful than a poor sahir 
— nearly all of the greatest sahirs in the 
history of the Suhhar Sulayman have been 
wealthy and privileged.
Some sahirs have a long-term mutually 
beneficial arrangement with a minor spirit, 
which is best represented by the (Realm) 
Spirit Companion Flaw. It is not uncom-
mon for young sahirs to have abused or 
angered spirits before they joined the Suh-
har, giving them the Plagued by Spirit or 
Supernatural Nuisance Flaws.
Experience
Sahirs receive starting experience like 
normal companions. They begin character 
creation with Native Language at 5 and 45 
experience points to spend on their first 
five years. Then, in later life, most sahirs 
receive 15 experience points per year of 
their starting age (those with the Wealthy 
Virtue receive 20 and those with the Poor 
Flaw receive 10). 
Once the sahir has joined the Suhhar, 
he receives 25 experience points per year 
(30 if he is Wealthy, 15 if he is Poor). This 
represents his improved access to study

The Cradle & The Crescent
sources and magical resources.
Players should consider spending the 
character’s experience on the following 
Abilities:
• To cast spells, a sahir must have a 
score of 4 in one of the languages sa-
hirs use (Arabic, Parsi, or Greek). To 
read and write books, he needs this 
language score at 5 and Artes Libera-
les 1. (Most of the Suhhar’s books are 
written in Arabic.)
• Sahirs can often locate new spirits with 
Area Lore.
• Bargain is essential when sahirs want 
to convince spirits to aid them.
• Many magical effects require Concen-
tration to cast and maintain.
• Finesse is often used to manipulate ac-
tive magic.
• Leadership allows sahirs to lead 
groups of spirits, or other sahirs in the 
laboratory.
• A sahir is able to summon spirits more 
effectively with Penetration.
• Sahirs must somehow make a living. 
Often this is represented with scores 
in Profession: Apothecary, Profes-
sion: Scribe or Teaching, as these 
trades are typically practiced at buyut 
al-hikma. Other Abilities can be justi-
fied; the character’s total in the related 
Characteristic + Ability should at least 
equal 6.
• Realm Lore describes spirits and su-
pernatural places, useful for finding 
and identifying them.
• Knowledge of the Suhhar is governed 
by Organization Lore: Suhhar Sulay-
man. Their legal code and belief systems 
are covered by Islamic Law and Theol-
ogy: Islam; the latter combined with 
an Arabic score of 6 or more can help 
protect sahirs against jinn (see Chapter 
4: The Jinn, Jinni Weaknesses).
• Sahirs should not neglect the Abilities 
associated with their Solomonic arts 
(Area Lore, Artes Liberales, Medi-
cine, Philosophiae, and Realm Lore), 
as these scores increase their lab totals 
and add to their casting totals when 
they cast spells without magical words 
or gestures.
Sahirs will likely spend experience on 
other Abilities appropriate to the charac-
ter, and on the Solomonic arts and other 
Supernatural Abilities that they have avail-
able to them during character creation be-
cause of Virtues, or because they have had 
The Gift opened by a teacher. A starting 
sahir should be able to summon a spirit 
with a Might Score of 10 using his sum-
moning art, and should have a score of at 
least 5 in one of the five Solomonic arts.
Sahirs can also purchase Solomonic 
spells during character creation, recorded 
like Hermetic spells and with a maximum 
level of (Intelligence + summoning art + 
Solomonic art + related Ability). Assuming 
that every sahir studies from appropriate 
lab texts, each spell costs a number of start-
ing experience points equal to its level. For 
example, a Level 15 spell costs 15 experi-
ence points. Sahirs can start with any spells 
that their players would like to design.
Spells are extremely valuable to sahirs, 
and a starting character should always in-
vest in a minimum of 120 spell levels, or 
his magic will be severely limited.
Spirits
Spirits are essential for a sahir — with-
out them he cannot cast any spells — and 
so a good sahir will collect Arcane Con-
nections to appropriate spirits, or learn 
summoning spells he can use for the same 
purpose. Also, since the sahir’s magic is 
basically channeled through the spirit he 
summons, the spirit’s nature and personal-
ity alters the sahir’s magic in subtle ways 
(in much the same way that spells cast by 
a Hermetic magus show evidence of his 
casting sigil). Thus, the unique qualities 
of the spirit a sahir calls have significant 
influence on his magic.
A starting sahir should choose one 
spirit that he can summon to be the focus 
of most of his magic, and assume that he 
has an Arcane Connection to it. He should 
also note something about its personality 
and powers in order to describe a cosmetic 
effect that accompanies his magic when-
ever he involves that spirit. If he has spent 
any of his experience points on summon-
ing spells, he may choose a spirit for each 
one. Unless he has a Virtue like Ghostly 
Warder or a Flaw like Magical Spirit Com-
panion, he cannot assume that any of 
these spirits will do him any favors with-
out being paid for their services or being 
compelled by his magic.
Laboratory Activities
Players can trade 10 experience points 
during character creation to have their 
sahirs spend a season in the laboratory in-
stead of studying, but only as many times 
per year as the character has free seasons. 
In this season, the character may perform 
any seasonal summoning activity described 
under Solomonic Magic. Assume that the 
character has access to half the maximum 
amount of vis as he can spend on the activi-
ty, and that he is working in an aura with no 
bonus or penalty. For activities that affect a 
spirit during character creation, such as the 
khadim bond or a greater binding, the sa-
hir must have an appropriate Virtue or Flaw 
that gives him a willing spirit companion.
Aging and Warping
Characters 35 years or older need to 
make an Aging roll for each year. Note 
that knowledge of Solomonic Alchemy 
and Solomonic Physic can influence the 
character’s Aging rolls (see The Solomonic 
Art, Magical Defenses, later in this chap-
ter). A typical sahir also gains 2 Warping 
Points each year after he starts studying 
and practicing Solomonic magic.
Solomonic 
Magic
The sahirs’ magic comes from their 
ability to summon spirits and direct them 
in limited ways. Over the many years they 
have been practicing this, sahirs have de-
veloped ways to modify their summoning 
powers so that instead of causing a spirit 
to manifest within a circle or other mystic 
container, they can draw upon its power 
to create other magical effects. These su-
pernatural means of affecting a target with 
Solomonic magic are collectively called 
“the Solomonic Art,” but each power is 


--- Page ---

34
The Cradle & The Crescent
also a “Solomonic art.” These arts (not 
technically Arts but rather Accelerated Su-
pernatural Abilities) are described in more 
detail later in this chapter.
The Solomonic Art can be used in two 
ways: to quickly cast memorized spells, 
or for long-term magical projects over a 
season or more. The former is called for-
mulaic summoning, and the latter is called 
seasonal summoning. Every sahir has (or 
should have) a summoning power, such 
as Sihr, that is used to summon a spirit or 
other sort of being and negotiate with it. 
Sahirs refer to this power as their summon-
ing art, but Sihr is sometimes considered a 
Solomonic art in its own right, and part 
of the Solomonic art as a whole (see The 
Solomonic Arts, Sihr).
Solomonic Spells 
(Naranjs)
A sahir’s spells are a recipe for draw-
ing upon a summoned spirit’s power in 
a way that creates a magical effect. This 
formula is called a naranj (“spell”). Sahirs 
generally know many naranjs, which 
they cast much as Hermetic magi cast 
their spells — by concentrating for a 
moment and speaking an incantation 
while gesturing at the target. Learning 
to cast a naranj takes a season of work 
in a special laboratory (described under 
Seasonal Summoning, in the next part of 
this section).
Summoning Spells
The most basic form of naranj avail-
able to sahirs uses their summoning art, 
and summons a spirit to a prepared place 
within a few paces of the caster. This is 
called a summoning spell. Unlike using 
their summoning art, this naranj only 
takes a moment and does not cost any 
fatigue or vis. The sahir is still warded 
against the spirit, and as usual the spirit 
likely wants something in return for 
whatever service the sahir asks. To cast a 
summoning spell, the player rolls a stress 
die and adds Presence plus his score in 
his summoning art, as well as his modifier 
for the aura.

secret, the child was raised at the acad-
emy and desired only to serve the sahirs, 
but as he grew older, his resemblance to 
the important family became more pro-
nounced. They decided to bring him 
into the Suhhar, and initiated him into 
Sihr. The first spirit he summoned was 
the being he believes to be his father: an 
Infernal jinni named Kharrat.
Kharrat is a pompous and arrogant 
spirit who believes that ‘Arkhaman’s desire 
to please his father will lead him to evil, 
and thinks he has him completely tamed. 
‘Arkhaman is naive, but has been warned 
by the older sahirs not to let Kharrat take 
advantage of him. So far, he has been able 
to control the jinni with vis, but as soon 
as possible Kharrat will get him to accept 
a duty and agree to seek out his mother. 
The shame that his presence will bring to 
her delights the wicked spirit.
‘Arkhaman only recently manifested 
The Gift, and the power he now wields 
has made him a bit wild. When he casts 
a spell, he often cannot resist casting an-
other (because of his Magic Addiction 
Flaw), and his presence generally makes 
those without The Gift uncomfortable 
(Tainted with Evil). His masters believe 
he needs to meet other Gifted sahirs or 
he will go mad; thus they have elected 
him their vizier and are sending him to 
Baghdad this summer to represent them.

Summoning Total:  
stress die + Presence  
+ summoning art + aura
Ease Factor: 
spirit’s Might Score
To succeed, the sahir must penetrate 
the summoned spirit’s Magic Resistance. 
Just as magi often do, sahirs can use Arcane 
Connections and sympathetic magic to 
boost their penetration — and since Solo-
monic summoning spells are designed to 
affect specific spirits, each summoning spell 
incorporates the spirit’s True Name, which 
is a permanent Arcane Connection to that 
spirit. This allows the player to add 5 to the 
sahir’s Penetration score multiplier when 
casting that particular summoning spell or 
using other Supernatural Abilities that must 
penetrate that spirit’s Magic Resistance to 
have an effect. (This usually means that the 
sahir multiplies his Penetration score by 6, 
since his multiplier starts at 1.)
Penetration Total:  
Summoning Total + sahir’s Penetration 
bonus – spirit’s Might Score
Formulaic and Ritual Spells
The most common type of naranj that 
sahirs learn are formulaic spells, which re-
quire that the sahir has already summoned 
a spirit and convinced it to serve him. (For

Kharrat may assume an illusory form 
that only his chosen victim, ‘Arkha-
man, can perceive. To ‘Arkhaman, 
the form appears to be a real person 
in all respects.
Protection of the Close Friend, 0 points, Init 
+3, Mentem: The chosen victim of 
Kharrat cannot act directly against 
it without extreme provocation; it 
would be akin to attacking one’s own 
mother. The victim may be as angry 
as they like with the demon, but ac-
tually physically opposing it requires 
a huge effort of will, which must be 
repeated every time the victim wants 
to renew his attacks.
Control Human, 2 points, Init equal to Qik, 
Mentem. If this power penetrates, 
Kharrat exerts direct control over its 
companion. It can issue commands 
that the target carries out to the best 
of his abilities; however, the target 
can attempt to break the control of 
the jinni every time he is asked to do 
something contrary to the tenets of 
his faith.
Envisioning, 1 or 2 points, Init +2, Men-
tem. This Power allows Kharrat to 
appear in the dreams of its sleeping 
companion (in which case it costs 1 
point), or make the target experience 
a waking dream or vision (in which 
case it costs 5 points). The shaitan 
cannot instantly make substantial 
changes to a dream, but instead grad-
ually twists it to take on darker and 
more frightening tone, and can speak 
through any figure from the victim’s 
subconscious. A waking dream is 
more obvious; the victim suffers an 
immediate and powerful hallucina-
tion of whatever the demon desires. 
This may be so frightening that the 
victim is stunned for a round, and 
must make a Brave Personality roll 
against an ease Factor of 9 or have an 
extreme reaction, such as retching, 
convulsions, or abject terror. This is 
the preferred way a qareen commu-
nicates with its chosen companion.

Appearance: Kharrat looks like a nor-
mal man with pale skin and com-
pletely black eyes that give off 
smoke like smoldering coals. He is 
generally in spirit form, where no 
one can see him.
Kharrat is a pompous and arrogant 
jinni (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). He de-
sires nothing more than to corrupt and 
control the sahir named ‘Arkhaman, who 
believes him to be his father. At every 
opportunity, he encourages ‘Arkhaman 
to behave recklessly and with sinful pride 
by goading him through his dreams, 
or by affecting him with his Obsession 
power. His plan is to help ‘Arkhaman to 
become a powerful sahir under his con-
trol, and then force him to help Kharrat 
rise in the infernal hierarchy by fighting 
other demons.
When used to channel Solomonic 
magic, Kharrat is strongly associated 
with a sickly shade of yellow, like tar-
nished brass or sandy mud. This colors 
‘Arkhaman’s magic much like a wizard’s 
sigil affects Hermetic spells.

The Cradle & The Crescent
a sahir with a spirit companion, this means 
that he must still formally summon the 
spirit using a summoning spell or his sum-
moning art before it can channel his magic 
for him.) They use the sahir’s knowledge 
of the Art to direct his summoned spirit’s 
power into a magical effect.
When casting formulaic spells, the 
sahir must have summoned the spirit that 
powers the effect himself, he must be close 
enough to the spirit that it can see him and 
hear his voice, and he must either speak 
in a firm voice with bold gestures or per-
form a mundane activity associated with 
the effect. For example, when casting a 
formulaic spell associated with Solomonic 
Physic, the sahir may choose to administer 
to the patient as a physician rather than 
obviously performing sorcery.
Using an Ability in this way generally 
adds about 15 minutes per magnitude of 
the spell to the casting time, but becomes 
more difficult to recognize as a magical ef-
fect. For example, to see through the cover 
activity, a suspicious character might roll 
his Perception + the Ability against the sa-
hir’s Presence + the Ability. Success would 
suggest to the suspicious character that the 
sahir is doing something unusual, though 
he still might not know what that is.
Whenever a sahir summons a spirit, 
either using a summoning spell or his sum-
moning art, note the difference between 
his Summoning Total and the spirit’s Might 
Score. This is called the sahir’s Summon-
ing Strength. It describes the amount of 
extra supernatural power that the sahir 
has drawn from the spirit during the sum-
moning, and applies to every naranj cast 
through that particular spirit (and typical-
ly improves his position when bargaining 
with it as well).
Some summoning arts allow the sahir 
to summon a spirit even if his total does 
not exceed the target’s Might Score; a neg-
ative Summoning Strength means the sa-
hir is less able to direct his magic through 
that particular spirit, and thus gives him a 
penalty to his casting total.
Summoning Strength:  
Summoning Total – spirit’s Might Score
Casting a formulaic spell requires 
that the sahir’s player make a stress roll, 
to which is added his Presence, his score 
in the Solomonic art associated with the 
effect, his Summoning Strength, and his 
aura modifier. If the sahir performs the ef-
fect using an Ability, add his Ability score 
to the total.
Formulaic Spell Casting Total:  
stress die + Presence + Solomonic art  
+ Summoning Strength  
+ aura (+ appropriate Ability, if used)
Ritual spells are more powerful formu-
laic spells. They cost vis — one pawn of 
an appropriate type for each magnitude of 
the effect — and have ongoing durations 
that are maintained by the spirit and can 
last indefinitely. Any formulaic spell can 
be cast as a ritual spell, allowing the sahir 
greater control over the effect (described 
in the guidelines later in this chapter). 
There are also many special guidelines for 
effects that are only ritual spells.
To maintain a ritual spell, the spirit 
must concentrate. If it is distracted, make 
a Stamina + Concentration stress roll for 
it, with the Ease Factor varying on the 
severity of distraction. Failure means the 
effect ends.
Whenever a sahir casts a naranj 
through a spirit that is already maintain-
ing one or more ritual spells, the sahir’s 
player makes a Perception + Finesse roll 
with Ease Factor equal to (6 x (the number 
of active ritual spells)). If he fails, he can-
not complete the spell and it has no effect. 
Most ritual spells allow the sahir to cancel 
them at will, and he may choose to do this 
before he rolls.
Ritual spells cannot be disguised with 
an Ability, although the sahir may still 
draw upon his knowledge to increase his 
Casting Total. This adds fifteen minutes 
per magnitude of the spell to the casting 
time. Note that unlike Hermetic ritual 
spells, Solomonic ritual spells cast without 
incorporating an Ability only take a mo-
ment to cast, just like a formulaic spell.
Ritual Spell Casting Total:  
spend vis, stress die + Presence  
+ Solomonic art + Summoning Strength 
+ aura (+ appropriate Ability, if used)
With both types of naranj, if the sa-
hir’s Casting Total is less than the level, his 
Summoning Strength with that spirit is re-
duced by the difference, and he loses one 
Fatigue level for every 5 levels by which 
he missed. If this fatigue causes him to fall 
unconscious, the spell fails; otherwise, the 
effect manifests.
If the target is protected by Magic 
Resistance, the effect must penetrate. To 
determine success, players use the spirit’s 
Penetration Total instead of the sahir’s, ap-
plying its realm interaction modifiers to 
determine if the target is affected. (This 
often means that it is advantageous for the 
sahir to summon an Infernal spirit when 
casting in an Infernal aura, for example.)
Because the sahir is using the spirit’s 
power to penetrate, he cannot use Ar-
cane Connections or sympathetic magic 
to boost the Penetration Total for his for-
Spells with Arcane Connections
Solomonic magic allows sahirs to 
invent summoning spells that incorpo-
rate a permanent Arcane Connection. 
This is very similar to a True Name, a 
supernatural formula similar to a spell 
that mystically identifies the target. Like 
any Arcane Connection, summoning 
spells do not stack with other Arcane 
Connections for increased Penetration, 
but may be combined with sympathetic 
connections such as the spirit’s horo-
scope or a symbolic representation of it 
for additional bonuses. These summon-
ing spells and their associated Arcane 
Connections can be taught to other 
sahirs and described in texts like any 
other spell.
Solomonic magic has not yet incor-
porated Arcane Connections into other 
types of spells — perhaps because sahirs 
have few uses for an Arcane Connection 
once they have summoned a spirit — 
though this may be something that they 
are working on. Also, such a discovery 
would be a great benefit to magi, and an 
excellent subject for original Hermetic 
research (see Integration, Hermetic True 
Names, later in this chapter).

mulaic or ritual spells, and the calculation 
always uses the spirit’s Penetration score, 
not the sahir’s.
Formulaic or Ritual Spell  
Penetration Total:  
spirit’s Might Score + spirit’s  
Penetration bonus + spirit’s aura  
modifier – spell level
Finally, unless the sahir has The Gift, 
the highest level of formulaic or ritual spell 
he can cast is limited by the summoned 
spirit’s Might Score. For example, to cast 
a Level 35 formulaic spell, an unGifted sa-
hir must summon a spirit with 35 Might or 
more. The Gift allows a sahir to make up 
the difference between his spirit’s Might 
and the effect level with his own inherent 
magical power, but unGifted sahirs do not 
have this advantage.
Spell Level Limit (unGifted):  
Might Score of summoned spirit
When sahirs botch their casting rolls, 
they receive one Warping Point for each 0 
on the botch dice. If this gives them two 
or more Warping Points, they must check 
for additional bad effects (see Warping 
and Corruption, later in this chapter).
Vis (Taqa)
Sahirs use a great deal of vis, and they 
tend to describe it in unique terms, such as 
“the claw from the black beast Ashmael” or 
“magic incense made by Istvaan al-Makki.” 
The general term they use is taqa (TAW-
qa), which is also a unit of measurement. 
For example, a sahir might say he has four 
taqa in a red stone, warm to the touch; or 
a single taqa in the pelt of a holy lamb, in-
nocent and pure. One taqa is functionally 
equivalent to one Hermetic pawn.
By activating vis, a sahir can increase 
his Casting Total when casting formulaic 
or ritual spells. Each vis of a type appro-
priate to the effect gives him a +2 bonus. 
He can also increase his Summoning Total 
when casting a summoning spell using vis 
(this improves both his penetration and 
his Summoning Strength). Each vis that 
matches the form of the summoned spir-
it’s Might gives him a +2 bonus, and any 
other type gives him a +1 bonus. He can-
not spend more on a single naranj than his 
score in the associated art, however.
Vis Limit:  
score in summoning art  
(summoning spell) or Solomonic art 
(formulaic or ritual spell)
When casting ritual spells, the vis re-
quired for the effect counts toward this 
limit. This means that to cast a ritual spell, 
the sahir’s score in the associated art must 
always at least equal its magnitude.
Seasonal Summoning
The other sort of Solomonic magic 
is called seasonal summoning, because it 
takes place over the course of a season. 
At the beginning of the process the sahir 
summons a spirit to him, and draws upon 
that spirit’s supernatural power over the 
course of the season to enable more in-
tensive magical activities. It is essentially 
the sahir’s equivalent to Hermetic labora-
tory magic.
The sahir performing a seasonal activ-
ity must have summoned a spirit at the be-
ginning of the project, which must remain 
present for the entire season or his effort 
is wasted. It must maintain the effects as 
it does for ritual spells, essentially concen-
trating on what the sahir is doing, and so it 
cannot activate its powers or perform any 
other activities that require its attention 
that season.
Most seasonal activities use a standard-
ized total — called a “lab total” for conve-
nience — this is the sahir’s Intelligence, his 


--- Page ---

38
The Cradle & The Crescent
score in the Solomonic art associated with 
the effect, his score in the mundane Abil-
ity associated with the lab activity, and his 
Summoning Strength with the spirit that is 
assisting him that season. He also receives 
his aura modifier for performing magic.
Lab Total:  
Intelligence + appropriate  
Solomonic art + appropriate Ability  
+ Summoning Strength + aura
This is shortened later as a “(Solo-
monic art) + (Ability) Lab Total,” speci-
fying the art and Ability associated with 
each activity.
As with spells, unless the sahir has 
The Gift, all of his effects are limited by 
the spirit’s Might Score — for example, a 
sahir who has summoned a spirit with 15 
Might cannot invent spells greater than 
Level 15.
Lab Effect Level Limit (unGifted): 
spirit’s Might Score
A Solomonic Laboratory
Like Hermetic labs, a sahir’s work 
space must be a room protected from the 
elements with at least 500 cubic paces of 
space. It requires equipment appropriate to 
the sahir’s fields of expertise and proper or-
ganization of materials; this takes a person 
with an academic and arcane background a 
single season to set up, after which it may 
be used with a –3 penalty to all activities.
If a Solomonic laboratory is estab-
lished or reorganized by a person with a 
score of 3 in one of the five Abilities asso-
ciated with the Art (Area Lore, Artes Libe-
rales, Medicine, Philosophiae, or Realm 
Lore), then the penalty to that activity is 
eliminated. For example, a sahir with Artes 
Liberales 3 and Philosophiae 3 could es-
tablish a laboratory with no penalty for 
alchemical (Philosophiae) or astrological 
activities (Artes Liberales), but would still 
have a –3 penalty to other lab activities.
Literate sahirs working in laboratories 
take notes, usually in Arabic, which can 
produce lab texts that other sahirs may 
study. These work just like Hermetic lab 
texts (ArM5, pages 101–102).
Sahirs can also assist each other in the 
laboratory, and this practice is much more 
common in the Suhhar than in the Order 
of Hermes — so much so that their pro-
cess is more efficient and effective than 
the Hermetic version. All participants 
must have the required Solomonic arts, 
and one of the sahirs working on the proj-
ect must have a Leadership score equal 
to (the number of participants – 1). Each 
sahir who participates in the project adds 
his Intelligence to the lab total, plus his 
score in the Ability related to the effect, 
and the final result uses the highest value 
among the participants in the appropri-
ate Solomonic art. Only the sahir with 
the highest Solomonic art must summon 
a spirit to assist them that season. This 
means that it is common to involve a com-
petent manager in a Solomonic lab activ-
ity, even one with a negative Intelligence, 
because it increases the number of sahirs 
who can work together.
Not counting time spent away from 
the lab for sleep and weekly religious ob-
servances, sahirs may miss up to ten days 
of a seasonal activity with no penalty. 
Beyond this, the sahir’s lab total receives 
a –10 penalty, and –2 for each work day 
missed. If multiple sahirs are working to-
gether, the number of person-days that 
may be missed with no penalty is multi-
plied by the number of participants, and 
any penalty is divided by this same num-
ber, rounding up. For example, three sahirs 
may miss up to 10 days each with no pen-
alty, or only one of them may miss up to 
30 days. If together they miss a total of 34 
days (perhaps because two were absent 10 
days and the third was gone for 14 days), 
their lab total would receive a –6 penalty 
(–10 for more than 30 days, –2 for each 
of four days over 30, yielding a penalty of 
–18, divided by 3 for –6). Players should 
not include the scores for any sahirs who 
fail to contribute at least 10 days of work, 
and if any individual sahir’s penalty before 
dividing exceeds the overall lab total, the 
entire project simply fails.
Sahirs can perform more than one lab 
activity in a season. Add together the ef-
fect levels required for all of the activities, 
and use the lowest lab total among them. 
As long as this is great enough to equal 
or exceed the sum of all effect levels, any 
number of activities may be performed 
at once. For those activities where prog-
ress is measured by how much the sahir’s 
lab total exceeds the effect level, divide 
the excess among all activities, rounding 
down any fractions.
Vis Manipulation
A sahir with Solomonic Alchemy can 
extract vis from a supernatural aura as a sea-
sonal activity, concentrating the power of 
the realm into a specific object. This pro-
duces a number of pawns of what magi call 
Vim vis, equal to one-tenth his Solomonic 
Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total.
Vis Extraction:  
pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy  
+ Philosophiae Lab Total) / 10
Sahirs can also forcefully remove vis 
from supernatural beings or enchanted 
objects. This is an excruciating process 
for creatures that feel pain, which must be 
restrained for the season, and is consid-
ered a grave offense by the Suhhar when 
practiced on unwilling jinn or other intel-
ligent spirits.
A maximum number of vis equal to 
one-fifth of the sahir’s Solomonic Alchemy 
+ Philosophiae Lab Total can be removed 
in one season. For each pawn removed, ei-
ther the supernatural being’s Might Score 
is reduced by 1, one invested effect is re-
moved from an enchanted device, or one 
pawn’s worth of space is cleared from an 
invested object with no invested effects. If 
the sahir’s (lab total / 5) is greater than the 
pawns this would yield, no additional vis 
is produced. Removed vis is affiliated with 
the realm of the being or the power that 
created the enchanted object, and is of a 
type appropriate to the effect or Might of 
the being.
Vis Removal:  
pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy  
+ Philosophiae Lab Total) / 5
A sahir can also transfer vis from one 
object into another, a number of pawns 
equal to half his Solomonic Alchemy 


--- Page ---

39
The Cradle & The Crescent
+ Philosophiae Lab Total. This is com-
monly used to separate large chunks of vis 
into more manageable units, and does not 
work on vis that is part of a living creature 
or has been invested into an enchanted 
device. The process usually destroys the 
original vessel, and if an object contains 
more vis than the sahir can transfer, the 
excess is lost.
Vis Transfer:  
pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy  
+ Philosophiae Lab Total) / 2
Sahirs have a limit on the number of 
pawns of vis they can use on any seasonal 
activity, equal to their score in the associ-
ated Solomonic art. For example, a sahir 
with Solomonic Alchemy 10 can only 
extract 10 pawns of vis from an aura in a 
single season.
Vis Limit:  
score in associated Solomonic art
Arcane Connections
Like Hermetic magi, sahirs can fix Ar-
cane Connections, making them perma-
nent. This costs them a pawn of Vim vis, 
and requires a score of at least 1 in Solo-
monic Astrology (because of the vis limit). 
When performing multiple activities in 
one season, this activity is considered a 
Level 5 effect.
Fix Arcane Connections:  
Solomonic Astrology  
+ Artes Liberales Lab Total
Sahirs can also transfer an Arcane 
Connection from one object to another. 
This requires a pawn of Vim vis and an 
appropriate object to become the new 
connection. I t does not affect the original 
connection, and so creates a new Arcane 
Connection. When performing multiple 
activities in one season, this is considered 
a Level 5 effect.
Transfer Arcane Connections:  
Solomonic Astrology  
+ Artes Liberales Lab Total
Naranjs
Sahirs learn their spells using the same 
mechanics as magi. They can invent a 
number of formulaic or ritual spells with 
total level equal to their teacher’s high-
est applicable lab total, substituting the 
teacher’s score in Teaching for the asso-
ciated Ability; or by the sahir collecting 
enough points above the spell level in the 
associated art + Ability lab total over the 
course of one or more seasons to equal it. 
Sahirs often make use of laboratory texts 
to speed this process.
Learning Spells:  
spell levels equal to teacher’s highest 
applicable Teaching Lab Total
Inventing Formulaic or Ritual Spells: 
(appropriate art + appropriate Ability 
Lab Total – effect level) points  
towards spell level
Summoning spells use the teacher’s 
Solomonic Astrology + Teaching Lab 
Total or the sahir’s Solomonic Astrology 
+ Artes Liberales Lab Total (though sum-
moning spells are so widespread that the 
sahir does not need to know Solomonic 
Astrology to do this). The spell level is 
the spirit’s Might Score, and unless the 
sahir has a Laboratory Text he must pos-
sess an Arcane Connection to the spirit, 
or else it must be present in the lab for 
part of the season.
If a sahir knows the True Name of a 
spirit (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, pages 
34-35), he can reinvent it as a summoning 
spell as if it were a Level 5 effect.
Inventing Summoning Spells:  
(Solomonic Astrology + Artes Liberales 
Lab Total – effect level) points  
towards spell level
Bindings
Sahirs can attach their summoned 
spirits to inanimate objects, essentially 
creating magical devices that produce a 
magical effect designed especially for the 
object when activated. These are called 
bindings. They can be given to others to 
use, even others who do not understand 
Solomonic magic. It is said the Umayyad 
wazirs and other early summoners who 
knew this process created many such 
devices, some of which still exist in hid-
den caches in the desert or within musty 
dwellings used by ancient sorcerers. Jabir, 
one of the members of the First Council, 
is said to have possessed a binding created 
by Solomon himself.
The first type of binding is known as 
a lesser binding. This superficially ties the 
spirit to an object, creating a mystical con-
nection between the two, and includes a 
trigger activity that releases the effect in 
a momentary burst of power. Lesser bind-
ings take a season to make, and can hold 
any effect the sahir can invent, with level 
of up to half the sahir’s Philosophiae Lab 
Total. When binding ritual spell effects, 
the sahir spends the necessary vis as part 
of making the enchantment, and once ac-
tivated the effect lasts for as long as the 
spirit maintains it.
Lesser Bindings:  
effect level equal to (appropriate art  
+ Philosophiae Lab Total) / 2
Sahirs can also create a greater bind-
ing. This is where the spirit is held cap-
tive by an object to power an effect. The 
effects invested into this object continue 
indefinitely, and may activate repeatedly: 
each time someone performs a trigger ac-
tion associated with an effect, that effect 
ends and is immediately cast again on an-
other target chosen by the wielder. If the 
object is damaged or destroyed, all active 
effects cease and the associated spirits are 
freed. While bound, the spirit may be sum-
moned, but it cannot use any of its pow-
ers, regenerate its Might Pool, move from 
where it is summoned, communicate more 
than short sentences, power Solomonic 
naranjs, or maintain other ritual spells. 
The Suhhar forbids sahirs from binding an 
intelligent spirit in this way, but there are 
many types of unintelligent spirits that are 
ideal for this sort of application (elemental 
spirits, for example).
To make a greater binding, the sahir 
must first enchant the object by which the 
spirit will be held captive. This enchant-

The Cradle & The Crescent
ment binds the spirit and any invested ef-
fects with Vim vis, which must be trans-
ferred into the object over the course of a 
season, “opening” it for the binding. Every 
object has a maximum number of pawns 
of vis it can hold, found by calculating 
the number of Base Points for the object’s 
size and material on the Material and Size 
Table (ArM5, page 97). There is no ben-
efit to sahirs for using an object of any 
particular shape or material except one: a 
literal container (a bowl, jar, bottle, lamp, 
or even a skull) can hold twice as many 
pawns of vis, and the sahir receives a +5 
bonus to his Lab Total whenever he binds 
an effect to it.
The maximum number of pawns of vis 
the sahir can transfer into an enchantment 
in one season is equal to his Solomonic Al-
chemy score, but he may add vis to an en-
chantment in subsequent seasons as long 
as the maximum has not been reached. 
Enchanting an object for a greater binding 
is a Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae 
activity with level equal to the number of 
pawns invested. It is possible to open an 
object for enchantment and bind a spirit 
and effect to it in one season, as long as 
the character’s Lab Total is great enough 
to accommodate both activities.
Binding Enchantments:  
(Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae 
Lab Total – pawns of vis to be invested) 
points towards the number of pawns  
of vis to be invested
To bind a spirit and effect to an en-
chanted device, design the effect as a spell 
using the sahir’s Philosophiae Lab Total 
with the associated art. Each magnitude of 
the spirit’s Might Score and each magni-
tude of the effect takes up “space” in the 
object equal to one pawn from the initial 
enchantment. As long as there is enough 
space in the enchantment to accommo-
date both the effect level and the Might of 
the spirit, the sahir can perform the bind-
ing. He can even bind the spirit and effect 
in one season if his Philosophiae Lab Total 
is at least double the effect level; otherwise 
it takes multiple seasons to accumulate 
enough points to complete it.
Greater Bindings:  
(appropriate art + Philosophiae Lab 
Total – effect level) points towards  
effect level
A sahir without Solomonic Alchemy 
may still bind spirits and effects to an ob-
ject that has been opened by another.
The sahir can place additional effects 
into the object in later seasons, as long 
as there is still space available, either by 
binding more spirits to the object or by 
binding the effect to a spirit that is already 
imprisoned in it. A bound spirit can only 
maintain one effect at a time.
When the wielder activates a greater 
binding with a ritual effect, the bound 
spirit must spend a Might Point for each 
magnitude of the effect, which the spirit 
does not recover for as long as it is bound. 
If the spirit runs out of Might Points, its 
Might Score is reduced by 1 and its Might 
Pool is replenished. Once its Might Score 
is reduced to 0, it can do nothing but 
maintain the last effect it triggered. Spirits 
do usually regain their lost Might Scores 
eventually, though this typically takes a 
very long time, at least a year per Point 
lost, and often longer.
A binding is an Arcane Connection to 
the bound spirit, and the spirit knows the 
triggering actions to activate the device. 
For sahirs, investigating enchantments is 
often as simple as summoning the spirit 
and asking what it can do.
Seeking and Scouring
A sahir can locate new spirits to 
summon as a seasonal lab activity. This 
requires knowledge of Solomonic Story-
telling, an applicable Area Lore Ability, 
an Arcane Connection to the area he is 
searching, and a pawn of form-appropri-
ate vis. The sahir casts a kind of magical 
net over the area that finds and holds an 
appropriate spirit. Then, he may either 
invite the spirit to visit him in his labo-
ratory, which is called seeking, or force 
the spirit to come to him, which is called 
scouring. The maximum value of the 
spirit’s Might Score is equal to the sahir’s 
Solomonic Storytelling + Area Lore Lab 
Total when seeking, or half the that total 
when scouring.
Maximum Might Score (Seeking):  
Solomonic Storytelling  
+ appropriate Area Lore Lab Total


--- Page ---

41
The Cradle & The Crescent
Maximum Might Score (Scouring): 
(Solomonic Storytelling  
+ appropriate Area Lore Lab Total) / 2
Either activity brings a spirit applica-
ble to the sahir’s summoning art by the end 
of the season, causing it to appear within 
a magic summoning circle that prevents 
it from affecting anyone or anything out-
side the ring for as long as it remains un-
broken. When summoned by seeking, the 
spirit may return to where it came from 
at any time; when summoned by scouring 
the spirit is held captive. In either case, 
the sahir can return it by simply looking 
at it and concentrating.
The sahir cannot decide what spirit 
comes, as the magic targets the area, not 
individual spirits. This means that the spirit 
summoned by this activity is essentially up 
to the storyguide to describe. See the vari-
ous Realms of Power books for powers a sum-
moned spirit might have, and what spirits 
with different Might Scores look like. In 
the Mythic Middle East, jinn are common, 
as are elemental spirits. Infernal spirits are 
also especially likely (though since it is a 
form of magical detection, they are never 
forced to answer a scouring), and Divine 
spirits are generally unlikely. Ultimately, 
the storyguide should choose a spirit for 
the sahir that will enhance the story the 
players are telling.
Warding
A sahir can enchant an area or object 
with the power to repel spirits appropriate 
to his summoning art. The sahir devotes 
a season to preparing the effect, and then 
draws a mystic circle on the ground or on 
an object and ceremonially imbues it with 
magic by spending a pawn of Vim vis. 
(The vis and the formula for the ward may 
be taken from the laboratory and used 
once to enchant a circle drawn in an out-
side location, as long as both the sahir and 
the spirit through which he casts it partici-
pated in the lab activity.)
Any spirits normally targeted by the 
sahir’s summoning art cannot touch the 
person carrying the object or affect him 
with their powers, or cannot cross the 
circle or affect anything on the other 
side of it. They also cannot affect the en-
chanted circle or the object itself. These 
effects last until the object is damaged or 
destroyed, or the circle is broken, either 
deliberately or by the deteriorating forces 
of age or climate.
Creating a ward is a Solomonic Travel 
+ (Realm) Lore activity, of the realm af-
filiated with the sahir’s summoning art, 
and his lab total determines the maximum 
Might Score the ward can affect.
Maximum Might Score Warded:  
Solomonic Travel  
+ (Realm) Lore Lab Total
Solomonic wards must penetrate the 
Magic Resistance of any spirits affected by 
them. Calculate the sahir’s Penetration To-
tal based on the Might of the spirit power-
ing the effect, minus the level of the ward. 
As with spells, the sahir cannot improve 
the spirit’s Penetration bonus with Arcane 
Connections, though a supernatural aura 
at the site of the ward can modify the ef-
fect’s Penetration Total.
Servant Spirits (Khuddam)
An intelligent spirit that agrees 
to serve a sahir and assist him with his 
magic may be enchanted with special 
properties that help the sahir whenever 
he casts spells through that spirit. This 
spirit is called a khadim (fem., khadima; pl., 
khuddam), meaning “servant,” and the en-
chantment is called “the khadim bond.” 
These terms are thought to derive from 
the name Al-Khidr, the spirit who served 
Al-Hajjaj of the First Council among oth-
ers, and thus “servant” does not have a 
derogatory or submissive connotation in 
this context.
To establish the khadim bond, the sa-
hir generates a Realm Lore Lab Total no 
less than the spirit’s Might Score, using 
the Realm Lore associated with the spirit 
and his highest Solomonic art. He must 
also spend a number of form-appropriate 
pawns of vis equal to the magnitude of the 
spirit’s Might Score. This gives the sahir 
the same number of Bond Points (equal to 
the magnitude of the spirit’s Might Score) 
to spend on the following benefits:
Safety: Subtract 1 botch die from the 
sahir’s summoning, casting, and Fatra 
Bayna Avoidance rolls (see Warping 
and Corruption, later in this section).
Casting: Add 2 to the sahir’s Casting Total.
Finesse: Add 3 to the sahir’s Finesse rolls.
Concentration: Add 2 to both the spirit’s 
and the sahir’s Concentration rolls.
Penetration: Add 5 to the spirit’s Penetra-
tion Total.
From then on, whenever the sahir sum-
mons and casts spells through that spirit, 
he receives the benefits of all Bond Points 
he has invested into it. These benefits are 
purchased on a pyramid scale, so that 3 
Bond Points spent on Safety subtracts 2 
botch dice, and 10 Bond Points spent on 
Penetration yields a +20 bonus. A sahir 
may perform the lab activity more than 
once with the same spirit, but this only al-
lows him to reallocate his Bond Points; the 
benefits are not cumulative. A sahir can 
create bonds with multiple spirits, though 
the same spirit cannot have a bond with 
more than one sahir.
Enchanting a Khadim:  
highest Solomonic art + (Realm) Lore 
Lab Total, equal to spirit’s Might Score
Al-Iksir (The Elixir of Life)
The secret of Al-Iksir was said to have 
been brought to the original council by 
Al-Hajjaj, who received it from Al-Khidr. 
The sahir summons a spirit into a liquid 
concocted from vis and other materials 
and then consumes it, taking properties of 
the spirit into himself. This frees the spirit 
and purifies the sahir, giving him a taste of 
immortality in exchange for experiencing 
Warping and other effects. The process is 
intensely personal, and while a sahir can 
invent his own formula based on another 
sahir’s laboratory text, he cannot make one 
for anyone but himself.
Al-Iksir is a Medicine activity, using 
any of the traditional Solomonic arts: 
Solomonic Alchemy purifies the body, 
Solomonic Astrology aligns the sahir with 
beneficial influences, Solomonic Physic 
promotes overall health, Solomonic Story-


--- Page ---

42
The Cradle & The Crescent
telling nourishes the soul, and Solomonic 
Travel exposes the sahir to favorable oth-
erworldly environments.
Al-Iksir:  
highest Solomonic art  
+ Medicine Lab Total
The process takes a season of effort, 
and costs a number of form-appropriate 
pawns of vis equal to the sahir’s (Lab Total 
/ 5). This gives him the same number of 
Al-Iksir Points to spend on the following 
beneficial effects:
Al-Iksir Points: 1
Beneficial Effects: Remove an Aging Point; 
Reduce Age and Apparent Age by 2; 
Reduce Apparent Age by 10 
Al-Iksir Points: Points equal to the abso-
lute value of the Characteristic.
Beneficial Effects: Improve a decreased 
Characteristic by 1, though not above 
the character’s starting score.
After the potion is consumed, the sahir 
must also spend the same number of Al-Ik-
sir Points on the following negative effects:
Al-Iksir Points: 1
Negative Effects: Gain two Warping 
Points and check for Fatra Bayna (see 
Warping and Corruption);  
Lose memories and associated knowl-
edge, removing a simple die’s worth 
of experience points, usually starting 
with childhood.
Al-Iksir Points: 2
Negative Effects: Gain an eccentric 
Personality Trait at +3, or increase 
this Trait by 1 if the sahir already has 
one, which becomes an obsession at 
+6 and madness at +10.
Al-Iksir Points: 3
Negative Effects: Gain a Minor Flaw ap-
propriate to the spirit’s influence.
The spirit’s Might Score is also tempo-
rarily reduced by the number of Al-Iksir 
Points spent; this lost Might generally re-
turns at the rate of one point per year.
Once a sahir takes the potion, he be-
gins to age as an adult, even if he is not 
yet 35 years of age. For this reason, most 
sahirs wait until they reach old age before 
concocting Al-Iksir, preferring to experi-
ence its dramatic changes much later in 
life. Note also that sahirs have no way to 
remove Decrepitude Points, which will 
continue to accumulate as they gain Aging 
Points, and which will still eventually lead 
them to aging crises and death.
Initiating the Arts
It is a relatively simple process for a 
Gifted teacher to pass on the Solomonic 
arts to another student with The Gift. The 
teacher, a spirit summoned by the teacher, 
and the student with a summoning art 
spend a season together in a Solomonic 
lab, and the teacher performs a powerful 
ritual that opens all five Solomonic arts. 
This is a Magic Lore activity that is also as-
sociated with Solomonic Travel, but since 
it has been fully integrated into Solomonic 
magic, it does not require that the teacher 
possess that art.
Any art in which the teacher does not 
have at least a score of 5 gives the stu-
dent the Deficient Technique Flaw. If the 
student has any non-Solomonic Super-
natural Abilities or Arts, add their scores 
together and double the result, adding 
10 if The Gift has already been opened. 
Compare this to the teacher’s Opening 
Total, which is half his Solomonic Travel 
+ Magic Lore Lab Total; if this Opening 
Total is less than the sum of the charac-
ter’s scores in his powers, the teacher can-
not initiate the student.
Opening Total:  
(Solomonic Travel  
+ Magic Lore Lab Total) / 2
In order to pass on the magical se-
crets associated with the Art of Solomon 
to those who did not have The Gift, 
Muhammad al-Fazari — one of the six 
unGifted members of the First Council 
— discovered how to use his guardian 
spirit to initiate them through the power 
of the Magic Realm. Many of his line be-
lieve that this discovery, more than any 
other, led to the golden age of sahirs and 
the formation of the Suhhar Sulayman. 
This process also works on Gifted stu-
dents who have already been opened to 
another tradition, and for sahirs without 
a summoning art or who come to the tra-
dition from another one, this is typically 
their best method of entry.
The process involves the teacher 
summoning a willing spirit to carry the 
student, in spirit form, into the Magic 
Realm. During the season, the student 
undergoes a sort of dream journey ap-
propriate to the spirit, while his physical 
body remains in the lab in a deep sleep. 
The experience is very similar to what 
happens to Hermetic magi when they 
experience Twilight — he might find 
himself in the physical world, but in a 
ghostly form that is unable to affect his 
surroundings; or in a surreal environment 
surrounded by other spirits interrogating 
him, urging him to prove his worth; or 
reliving events of his past as if they were 
happening to him again.
While the student is in this state, his 
teacher performs the opening ritual and 
calculates his Opening Total. If this is 30 
or more, the student gains a Major Virtue 
associated with the Art of Solomon that 
is also possessed by the teacher, usually 
a Solomonic or a summoning art. With a 
total of 25, he gains the Major Virtue but 
also receives a Minor Flaw. With only 15, 
he gains the Major Virtue and a Major 
Flaw. These Flaws should be tied to the 
student’s travels in the Magic Realm.
Before the process is complete, the 
teacher spends form-appropriate vis equal 
to half the necessary Opening Total (7, 12, 
or 15 pawns of vis), and the spirit’s Might 
Score is reduced by the same amount. This 
reduction is not permanent, but it gener-
ally takes at least a year for the spirit to 
recover each point. The student also gains 
two Warping Points, though no check for 
Fatra Bayna (see Warping and Corruption, 
later in this section) is required.
To initiate an unGifted student in a 
summoning art and all five Solomonic arts 
using this method is time-consuming, vis-
consuming, and Might-consuming, and 
tends to produce sahirs with a weak grasp 
on reality due to accumulated Warping 
and Flaws. This is why unGifted sahirs 
tend to group in families, and generally 
teach their summoning art and Solomonic 
specialty only.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Experimentation
While it is nothing so grand as Her-
metic arcane experimentation, sahirs have 
a means of producing unexpected results 
in their laboratories, and by sharing these 
discoveries they can improve their tradi-
tion’s magic in slow and incremental steps. 
Because it requires that the sahir have more 
than one Solomonic art or power, Gifted 
sahirs tend to be the most inventive.
When designing a new effect, either 
inventing a formula or binding a spirit, the 
sahir may declare that he is experimenting 
by incorporating a second art or another 
power into the effect. His lab total then 
uses the lower of these two Abilities or 
Arts, and the player adds a simple die to the 
sahir’s lab total. The player should give the 
storyguide some idea of what he is hoping 
to achieve, based on the two powers.
After the project is completed, the sa-
hir makes an experimental stress roll. On 
a 0, check for botches to see if there is 
a disaster; otherwise the result is a story 
event determined by the storyguide. If the 
die result is 12 or more, the sahir makes 
a unique discovery related to one or both 
of the powers included, which replaces 
the original effect. For all other rolls, the 
results include a side effect related to the 
secondary power. For example, a Story-
telling/Astrology spell to put people to 
sleep might also tell the sahir the sleeping 
characters’ names.
Sahirs with Solomonic Astrology may 
apply one-fifth of their Solomonic Astrol-
ogy score to these rolls (see The Solomon-
ic Art, Magical Defense Bonuses, later in 
this chapter). This does not prevent them 
from botching if they roll a 0, but makes a 
discovery more likely. Sahirs with the In-
ventive Genius Virtue may similarly add 3 
to these rolls.
If multiple sahirs are working together 
on an experimental project, the players 
make a die roll for each participant, modi-
fied by appropriate Virtues and Solomonic 
Astrology scores, but also subtracting the 
number of participants from all of their to-
tals. For example, if there are three sahirs 
working together, each of them receives a 
–3 to their result. If no one botches and at 
least one character achieves a total of 12 or 
more, they make a unique discovery. Oth-
erwise, there is an appropriate side effect.
Unique discoveries from an experiment 
can be used to improve Solomonic magic 
in much the same way that magi improve 
Hermetic theory. If the sahir achieves a 
discovery and spends a subsequent season 
duplicating his efforts, and gets no 0s on 
the experimentation rolls, he stabilizes it 
and generates a number of Breakthrough 
Points equal to the effect’s magnitude. (He 
also gains this many Warping Points minus 
a simple die.) These Breakthrough Points 
accumulate to produce Minor, Major, or 
Solomonic Breakthroughs that can change 
how sahirs practice magic. (See Houses of 
Hermes: True Lineages, pages 26-30.)
Warping and Corruption
When a sahir receives two or more 
Warping Points as a result of a magical 
botch, there is the chance that he will lose 
control. Instead of channeling the spirit’s 
power as he desires, the spirit’s power 
overtakes him. He typically blacks out and 
awakens in another place: lost in an other-
worldly desert with nine moons and sand 
of every color; or perhaps held as a prisoner 
in the castle of his enemy, locked in a dark 
dungeon; or perhaps even bound in the 
position of his summoned spirit, watching 
as the spirit performs magic while drawing 
upon the sahir’s own life energy. Sahirs call 
this place (which many believe is separate 
from the Magic Realm) Bayna ((BEY-na), 
“Between”), and the experience Fatra Bayna 
((FA-tra BEY-na), “Time Between”).
Upon gaining the Warping Points, 
the sahir’s player may make a Stamina + 
Concentration roll (Solomonic Travel 
gives a Magical Defense Bonus to this 
roll, as described later). The Ease Factor 
is a stress die (no botch possible), plus the 
sahir’s Warping Score, plus the number of 
Warping Points he received, plus his aura 
modifier. If he rolls a 0, roll a botch die 
for each Warping Point gained. Success 
means there is no other effect. If he fails, 
he experiences Fatra Bayna.
Fatra Bayna Avoidance:  
stress die + Stamina + Concentration  
+ Solomonic Travel bonus vs.  
stress die (no botch) + Warping Score  
+ Warping Points received + aura
During Fatra Bayna, all of the sahir’s 
summoned spirits are released from his 
control, dispelled whether they want to de-
part or not, and all his active ritual effects 
end. What happens to his body varies; for 
some, it remains in stasis or transforms into 
a spirit form, while for others it continues 
to react and respond as if controlled by 
one of his summoned spirits. Some sahirs 
describe the experience as similar to what 
they imagine it is like for intelligent spirits, 
like jinn, when they are bound to an object 
or person against their will. The character 
continues to age while he is away, though 
he does not starve, asphyxiate, or suffer 
from exposure in the meantime.
Fatra Bayna lasts approximately two 
minutes at minimum, to approximately one 
year maximum. This duration is determined 
by a secret simple die roll according to the 
following chart. The sahir’s player does 
have some influence over the results, even 
though he does not see the roll; he may 
add or subtract 3 by spending a Confidence 
Point, and if the sahir possesses Solomonic 
Travel, the player may also add or subtract 
his Magical Defense Bonus. (Players should 
add to the roll if they want a better chance 
of positive effects, or subtract from it for 
fewer Warping Points and less time spent 
away from the physical world.)
Die roll	 Duration	 Effects
1 or less	
Diameter	
+3 Corruption Pts
2–4	
Sun	
+2 Corruption Pts
5–7	
Moon	
+1 Corruption Pt
8–9	
Season	
+1 Spirit Pt
10+	
Year	
+3 Spirit Pts
When he returns, the sahir receives 
a number of Warping Points equal to the 
modified roll, and a number of Spirit or Cor-
ruption Points, as indicated on the chart. 
These are similar to experience points in 
that they must be spent immediately; Spirit 
Points provide beneficial effects and Cor-
ruption Points negative effects. Sahirs are 
more likely to gain Corruption Points than 
Spirit Points, and for this reason Fatra Bay-
na is generally regarded as a phenomenon 
that punishes careless sahirs. Those who 
benefit from it are admired (or envied) for 
their wisdom and endurance.
Also, whenever a sahir’s Warping Score 
increases, he automatically receives an ad-
ditional Corruption Point, which must be

44
The Cradle & The Crescent
spent next time he experiences Fatra Bayna.
The storyguide may spend Spirit 
Points as follows:
Spirit Points: 1
Effects: Gain (Warping Score x 5) 
experience points in a summoning or 
Solomonic art;  
The sahir invents a new naranj with 
a level no greater than the sahir’s 
(Warping Score x 5);  
The sahir returns with (Warping 
Score x 5) vis of a type appropriate to 
the experience, collected within his 
person or his belongings;  
Gain 3 Confidence Points.
Spirit Points: 3
Effects:  Increase the sahir’s Confidence 
Score by 1;  
Gain a +1 cumulative bonus to all 
social interactions (leading, teaching 
and bargaining, but not summoning 
or casting). While the effects of The 
Gift or similar Flaws are unchanged, 
the sahir becomes better at talking 
his way around them. The bonus 
does offset simple penalties to social 
rolls imposed by The Gift or Flaws, 
however. For example, a Gifted sahir 
with the normal Gift who takes this 
effect once has a –2 penalty to social 
rolls, but still suffers from the distrust 
and dislike inspired by The Gift;  
Gain a Minor Virtue appropriate to the 
experience, or remove a Minor Flaw.
Corruption Points have the following 
effects, also chosen by the storyguide:
Corruption Points: 1
Effects: Make an immediate Aging roll, 
adding the sahir’s Warping Score to 
the total;  
Suffer a Heavy wound;  
Gain a bad Reputation among spirits 
from the appropriate realm at 2, or 
increase this Reputation by 1 if the 
sahir already has one.
Corruption Points: 3
Effects: Gain a –1 penalty to all social in-
teractions, which is cumulative with the 
effects of The Gift and similar Flaws;  
Gain a Minor Flaw appropriate to the 
experience, or lose a Minor Virtue.
Other sahirs and spirits who are famil-
iar with the sahir can usually tell, upon the 
character’s return, whether the experience 
was positive or negative, though this oth-
erworldly aspect fades quickly.
Integration
There is always the possibility that 
peaceful voices will prevail, and that magi 
and sahirs will work together to combine 
their magic into a unified tradition. Or 
perhaps one of them will learn enough 
about the other to steal their magical se-
crets and gain the upper hand. Here are 
some examples of discoveries that might 
be achieved in either case.
Hermetic True Names
Minor Breakthrough
Experimenting with True Names and 
Solomonic summoning spells has led the 
magus to the discovery of means to in-
corporate an Arcane Connection into a 
formulaic spell, making it a permanent 
component of that spell. From then on, 
the magus no longer needs the physi-
cal object to affect that target or loca-
tion or to invent new spells that target 
it through an Arcane Connection, and 
gains the bonus for a permanent Arcane 
Connection to his Penetration multiplier 
whenever he casts it. The new spell and 
associated Arcane Connection can then 
New Hermetic Virtues
Scientates Suleimanis
Major, Hermetic (Hermetic Breakthrough)
This breakthrough Virtue allows a 
magus to invent and cast spells that use 
any of the non-Ritual Solomonic guide-
lines, using Rego with a Form appropriate 
to the target. This is similar to craft magic, 
where magi produce goods through mag-
ic labor. For example, a magus with this 
Virtue could use ReTe to duplicate the 
alchemical process by which a gem’s qual-
ity is enhanced, or ReCo to encourage the 
body to recover fatigue more quickly.
Hermetic Realm Initiation
Major, Hermetic (Hermetic Breakthrough)
The magus may initiate students 
into Virtues in the same way sahirs do, 
by convincing a spirit to accompany the 
student into the Magic Realm. This uses 
the character’s Rego Vim Lab Total in-
stead of Solomonic Travel, and substi-
tutes Magic Theory for Magic Lore, but 
otherwise works the same way: costing 
vis, reducing the spirit’s Might Score, 
and Warping the student.
New Solomonic Virtues
Spontaneous  
Solomonic Spells
Major, Supernatural (Major Breakthrough)
The sahir possessing this Break-
through Virtue can cast formulaic spells 
spontaneously, the same way as magi 
do. To do this he must either lose a Fa-
tigue level and divide his Casting Total 
by 2, or not roll the stress die and divide 
his Casting Total by 5.
Independent  
Solomonic Magic
Major, Supernatural (Solomonic Breakthrough)
The sahir can cast and maintain 
Solomonic spells without channeling 
them through a spirit. This does not add 
his Summoning Strength to his Casting 
Total, and uses his Penetration Total in-
stead of the spirit’s. If he is unGifted, his 
independent spells and effects cast this 
way have no maximum level.

others to invent.

By studying the Solomonic arts and

monic magic allows sahirs to duplicate

emotions, and the supernatural realms. 
The magus then invents experimental 
Rego spells that produce similar effects. 
Once the breakthrough is achieved and 
the associated Virtue distributed, magi 
will be able to duplicate any Solomonic 
formulaic spell, including those overcom-
ing the Limit of Energy.
Hermetic Realm Initiation
Hermetic Breakthrough
After undergoing the initiation himself, 
instead of gaining a Solomonic art, the ma-
gus gains Insight into the Solomonic ini-
tiation process. This might produce a spell 
to warp another person with magic, or a 
ritual to open him to a Virtue possessed by 
the caster. This research eventually leads 
to a breakthrough with which the magus 
may initiate others into new Supernatural 
or Hermetic Virtues without the secrecy 
and lore of a Mystery Cult. Soon power-
ful magi may even learn to teach Hermetic 
magic to the unGifted, by initiating them 
into each Art.
Solomonic Devices
Minor Breakthrough
The sahir must study enchanted items 
made with Hermetic magic, which gives him 
Insight towards bindings made with similar 
effects. Through experimentation, he learns 
to build devices that do not require a spirit, 
but maintain concentration on their own. 
This discovery likely leads to a great wealth 
of invested items throughout the Mythic 
Middle East and beyond, as sahirs would be 
free to create items with lasting effects with-
out having to bind spirits to them.
Spontaneous Solomonic Spells
Major Breakthrough
Sahirs would greatly benefit from the 
ability to cast spells they have not memo-
rized. Studying Magic Theory provides 
Insight into this practice, perhaps yielding 
formulaic spells for which the sahir can 
change the parameters as he casts them. 
The Major Virtue this project produces 
would allow sahirs to cast spontaneous 
spells in the same way as magi, dividing 
their Casting Total by 2 or by 5. Because 
sahirs would need less time in their labora-
tories inventing new spells, this discovery 
could lessen the importance of buyut al-
hikma throughout the Suhhar, as more sa-
hirs might prefer seeking out more spirits 
or other adventuring activities during their 
free seasons to learning new spells.
Independent Solomonic Magic
Solomonic Breakthrough
By studying Hermetic magic, a sa-
hir could remove his need to channel a 
spirit’s power. This requires him to initi-
ate at least one Hermetic Technique and 
one Hermetic Form and study Magic 
Theory, but the Insights produced from 
these sources lead to spells that could be 
cast independently of a summoned spirit, 
with the sahir maintaining the effects and 
using the sahir’s Penetration Total. This 
would be especially valuable for unGift-
ed sahirs, as their spirits’ Might Scores 
would no longer limit their magic with 
these spells.
Solomonic Arts
The Art of Solomon, through its com-
ponent arts, has a wide range of effects 
described by the guidelines in this section, 
with sample spells to demonstrate how 
these effects might be used. Players may 
safely assume that every listed guideline 
has been developed into a naranj at one 
time or another.


--- Page ---

46
The Cradle & The Crescent
Most of the guidelines use magic to 
duplicate the natural results of practicing 
medieval science, and thus have a momen-
tary and permanent duration. However, 
some effects require ritual spells because 
their effects cannot be reproduced with 
mundane abilities and, like all rituals spells, 
have temporary effects that last only as 
long as they are maintained.
The sample spells sometimes reference 
a spirit by name (written as “[Spirit]”), but 
this is generally not exclusive. Unless the 
sahir has an appropriate Flaw, any spirit he 
summons may power any spell he casts.
Sihr
Sahirs use Sihr to summon jinn, and 
to provide mystic force behind the bar-
gain that places a jinni into their service. 
Strictly speaking, Sihr is not a Solomonic 
art, but is so common among sahirs that 
many Ashab al-Halqa (“Followers of the 
Circle,” the sixth sahir “family”) consider it 
the special power of their lineage. In some 
texts the Seal of Solomon is drawn with 
six points — this is seen as an attempt by 
these sahirs to spread the idea that Sihr is 
just as integral to Solomonic magic as the 
other families’ powers.
Sihr is said to originate from the leg-
endary Art of Solomon, and is sometimes 
referred to as Solomonic Sihr, or (Solo-
monic) Summoning. It is very similar to 
the Sihr that is still practiced in Iberia, 
though the two traditions split almost 
two hundred years ago. Solomonic Sihr 
is slightly more compatible with Solo-
monic magic, though sahirs can use ei-
ther version.
Discerning Jinn
Before a jinni is summoned, the sahir 
should study it to determine its strength. 
If the sahir can see spirits (with Second 
Sight, for example), then he can directly 
observe the jinni in its native habitat, and 
it takes him just a single round to make 
the necessary assessment. Without magi-
cal help, the sahir must use his knowledge 
of the local area to gather sufficient infor-
mation about the spirit who dwells there; 
the player should make an Intelligence + 
(Area) Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 
6 to discover the Form that the jinni takes 
and its likely powers. It takes about an hour 
for the sahir to make this assessment.
Once this preliminary research has 
been performed, the sahir can attempt 
to discern the jinni’s approximate Might, 
based on its appearance (if seen), its 
abode, and the sahir’s own knowledge. 
He must decide whether the jinni is Fa-
erie, Magic or Infernal (based on its be-
havior and attitude), and make an Intel-
ligence roll modified by the appropriate 
(Realm) Lore. Success reveals the mag-
nitude of the jinni’s Might. Failure indi-
cates the sahir is unable to guess, making 
summoning it more dangerous. The deci-
sion as to which (Realm) Lore to use is 
vital; if the player guesses wrongly, then 
this is a straight Intelligence roll. Since 
the player has no experience with jinn, 
the storyguide should make the distinc-
tion clear.
Discern Might:  
Intelligence + (Realm) Lore  
+ stress die against Ease Factor of 9
Summoning Jinn
Once discerned, the sahir may sum-
mon the jinni and attempt to bind it into 
service. This summons requires the jinni to 
be within range of the sahir’s voice, or else 
he needs an Arcane Connection. The sum-
mons takes at least 15 minutes to perform, 
during which the sahir chants words of 
command, makes prescribed gestures, and 
draws symbols on the ground. 
The summons generally includes an 
offering of vis, one pawn of a type ap-
propriate to the jinni’s form for every 
magnitude of the jinni’s Might Score, 
but the sahir can offer more (a maximum 
equal to the character’s Sihr score) or less 
(none, even). The sahir only has his own 
rough estimate of the jinni’s Might, so he 
may unwittingly offer more or less than 
the standard amount. This offering does 
not affect the Summoning Total, but it 
plays an important role in the bargaining 
which follows.
The sahir then generates a Summon-
ing Total based on his Sihr score. A suc-
cessful summons that also penetrates the 
jinni’s Magic Resistance forces it to take a 
physical form before the sahir. Calculate 
the Summoning Strength, which is the 
amount by which the sahir’s Casting To-
tal exceeds the Ease Factor. A botched roll 
results in an infuriated jinni, or perhaps a 
spirit different than the one intended.
Summoning Total:  
Presence + Sihr + aura + stress die
Ease Factor:  
jinni’s Might Score
Summoning Penetration:  
Summoning Total + sahir’s Penetration 
Bonus – jinni’s Might Score
Summoning Strength:  
Summoning Total – jinni’s Might Score
A failed summons has no effect, 
though the sahir can try again at the cost 
of a Fatigue level.
The sahir can spend extra time on 
a summons; each additional 15 minutes 
causes him to lose a long-term Fatigue lev-
el and adds another botch die to the Sum-
moning roll, but provides a +5 bonus to 
his Penetration Total. He can also spend 
vis, each pawn of the appropriate form 
giving him a +2 bonus to his Summoning 
Total, or a +1 bonus for each pawn of any 
other type.
Bargaining with the Jinni
After the jinni arrives, the sahir must 
bargain with it to gain its services. The 
power of Sihr ensures that the jinni cannot 
depart or attack until a bargain is struck 
or they have agreed no bargain can be 
achieved. A sahir who refuses to bargain 
releases the jinni from making a pact. 
“Bargain” may be misleading; a skilled sa-
hir can obtain the services of a weak jinni 
without offering anything in return. The 
arrangement is magically enforced: the 
jinni cannot break the terms unless the sa-
hir reneges first, and most jinn will obey 
the spirit of the agreement if treated well. 
A sahir can attempt to strike a bargain with

The Ease Factor has bargaining mod-
ifiers, which depend on what the sahir 
is asking from the jinni and what he of-
fers. Aiding the sahir with his magic for 
a day is a single task, which reduces the 
Ease Factor by 6 (–3 for “Service to last 
one day” and –3 for “Terms constitute a 
single task”).
A failed Bargaining Total results in a 
failure to make a bargain, and the jinni is 
not compelled to remain. A botch results 
in the sahir offending the jinni and tempo-
rarily acquiring either Supernatural Nui-
sance Flaw (for a weak jinni) or Plagued 
by Jinni (for a moderate or powerful jinni), 
which lasts for at least a month.
A successful bargain binds the jinni to 
the sahir for the duration. He can ask it to 
perform any task within its power, though 
the jinni cannot renege on any solemn 
oaths it has sworn prior to the summons 
and, for jinn who have adopted a religion, 
this includes disobeying the tenets of their 
faith. The jinni cannot make any new 
oaths without the sahir’s permission while 
bound in service.
Any vis offered by the sahir during the 
summoning is part of the terms of the bar-
gain and given to the jinni to use as it sees 
fit, and thus cannot be included in what-
ever task the sahir sets the jinni. A sahir 
Typical Duties for Sahirs
The supernatural realm to which 
the jinni is aligned can greatly influ-
ence the duty that it sets the sahir. 
Infernal jinn typically demand sinful 
duties, while faerie jinn want human 
attention, and magic jinn desire power 
and wealth. (See Chapter 4: Jinn, for 
more details.)
Small Duties
These include cleansing or protect-
ing the jinni’s home, guarding a human 
family to which the jinni has become at-
tached, retrieving stolen wealth, writing 
a poem in praise of the jinn, providing 
rare commodities such as frankincense 
or rubies, or obtaining vis from a par-
ticular source.
Heavy Duties 
These include fighting wizards who 
seek to enslave jinn, freeing slaves from 
captivity, playing a jest on an important 
local figure, delivering the heart of an 
enemy, traveling to a supernatural realm 
where the jinni cannot go, or procuring 
a unique item such as a book written in 
Solomon’s own hand.
Non-Magic Sihr
The description of Solomonic Sihr 
assumes that the power is aligned to the 
Magic realm, which is its most common 
form. However, versions of Sihr aligned 
to other realms have the following me-
chanical changes:
Faerie Sihr
The sahir adds the value of his 
highest good Reputation to his Bar-
gaining Total, subtracts his highest 
bad Reputation, and does not apply 
any other negative Reputations to his 
Bargaining modifier. The storyguide 
rules whether a particular Reputation 
is good or bad. (Sympathy Traits and 
Faerie Rank also apply to this roll, if 
you are using the rules from Realms of 
Power: Faerie.)
Divine Sihr
Though the sahir has no foreign 
aura penalties to his Summoning Total, 
he cannot offer vis, which always in-
creases the Ease Factor of the Bargain-
ing Total by twice the magnitude of the 
jinni’s Might Score.
Infernal Sihr
Failure on the Bargaining Total does 
not automatically permit the jinni to de-
part, and the sahir can hold it prisoner 
and continue to try and coerce it for as 
long as he likes, though each subsequent 
attempt costs him a Fatigue level. The 
storyguide should lower the Bargaining 
Total Ease Factor the longer the jinni is 
held captive: –1 after a day, –2 after a 
season, and –3 after a year.


--- Page ---

48
The Cradle & The Crescent
may offer vis of a different type than the 
jinni’s form, but it is less compelling. For 
example, when summoning a jinni with 10 
Might (Imaginem), a sahir who offers two 
pawns of vis will have his bargain modifier 
reduced by 4. If that vis is not Imaginem 
vis, his bargain modifier is then increased 
by 2.
Note that sahirs with The Gift typi-
cally suffer a penalty to all social inter-
actions, which affects this total. (Unlike 
the Parma Magica, Magic Resistance does 
not protect supernatural beings against 
the negative aura of those with The Gift, 
though some magical beings are immune 
to the effects.)
A sahir can only bind a limited number 
of jinn in service to him at a time, equal 
to his Leadership score plus one — even 
a sahir with no Leadership score can com-
mand at least one jinni.
Maximum Number of Bound Jinn:  
Leadership + 1
Solomonic Sihr is the most common 
summoning art in the Mythic Middle 
East. It is usually aligned with the Magic 
realm, though there are Divine, Faerie, 
and Infernal versions, each with slight 
functional differences (see the Non-Mag-
ic Sihr sidebar).
Solomonic Alchemy
Solomonic Alchemy affects non-liv-
ing matter, simple (water, air, fire, earth) 
or complex (i.e., metal, smoke, bone, 
wood). The sahir or the spirit must touch 
the target, and can affect up to one cubic 
pace of simple matter or 50 cubic inches 
of complex matter. Each additional magni-
tude added to the spell level multiplies the 
amount of matter he can target by 10.
These effects have one parameter, Al-
teration, which determines the magnitude 
of natural change that the sahir can im-
pose upon the matter. Thus, making dirt as 
sticky as clay is less difficult than making it 
as sticky as mercury.
Slight: The matter undergoes a subtle 
change in appearance or property, with-
in the common range of examples for 
that matter. For example, give water the 
scent of the sea, or change the color of a 
standard gemstone. (+0 magnitudes)
Minor: The matter undergoes a notice-
able change in appearance or prop-
erty. The change must be commonly 
found in nature, and of a general sort. 
For example, brighten moonlight to 
that of a torch, or condense air into a 
cloud. A Minor change can increase 
or decrease Size by one category. 
(+1 magnitude)
Substantial: The matter undergoes a 
significant change in appearance or 
property, uncommon in nature. For 
example, make water as caustic as 
acid, or iron as flexible as copper. 
A Substantial change can increase 
or decrease Size by two categories. 
(+2 magnitudes)
Major: The matter undergoes a total 
change in appearance or property, 
but no more than the extremes found 
in nature. For example, call lightning 
from a clear sky, or make stone as hard 
as diamond. A Major change can in-
crease or decrease Size by three cat-
egories. (+3 magnitudes)
When performing Solomonic Al-
chemy through a mundane activity using 
Philosophiae, the sahir must apply various 
reagents, powders, tinctures, or other in-
gredients to the target. These are typically 
Magical Defenses
In the same way magi receive super-
natural bonuses from their Form scores, 
sahirs have an innate form of “magical 
defense” from their Solomonic arts. Di-
vide the sahir’s score in each art by 5 to 
determine his Magical Defense Bonus, 
and see later for the specific applications 
of each art.
Solomonic Alchemy
From regular exposure to magic, 
the sahir’s body is rarefied, making him 
stronger, better able to endure hardship, 
and more resistant to physical dangers. 
Add his bonus to Soak, subtract it from 
Aging rolls (this is cumulative with Sol-
omonic Physic), and add it to Strength 
when calculating what he can carry 
without penalty.
Solomonic Astrology
Because of his heightened under-
standing of the heavenly signs and 
what they predict about the future, 
the sahir is more aware of events be-
fore they happen, and thus he is less 
likely to be surprised. Add his bonus to 
all of his Initiative rolls, and to his Per-
ception rolls associated with alertness 
or with intuition. This also positively 
influences his experimentation in the 
laboratory.
Solomonic Physic
The sahir with knowledge of Solo-
monic Physic is generally healthier. 
Add his bonus to his Recovery rolls and 
subtract it from Aging rolls (this is cu-
mulative with Solomonic Alchemy). In 
addition, he becomes less noticeable: 
add his bonus to rolls that involve being 
stealthy or unobtrusive, including his 
Defense when he is not attacking.
Solomonic Storytelling
The sahir’s presence is enhanced, giv-
ing him the bonus to rolls for non-magi-
cal social activities (cumulative with the 
bonus from Fatra Bayna) and increasing 
his Leadership score when commanding 
spirits or managing a laboratory. Also, 
he is more resistant to powers that tar-
get emotions; add his bonus to any rolls 
involving his Personality Traits.
Solomonic Travel
Exposure to the supernatural allows 
the sahir to add his bonus to otherworldly 
navigation rolls, and add or subtract it 
from his Fatra Bayna Avoidance rolls. He 
may also add this bonus to Stamina rolls 
to avoid fatigue, and to his Concentra-
tion and Finesse rolls when controlling his 
magic or resisting supernatural influences.

Spell Formulas
The spells given here are specially de-
signed for Solomonic Alchemy.
Sanctuary in the sand
Solomonic Alchemy Level 5
Alteration: Minor
This spell instantly purifies the area im-
mediately surrounding the sahir (10 cubic 
paces), making stale air easier to breathe 
and removing choking dust or smoke.
(Base 3, +1 Minor, +1 size)
[Spirit]’s oasis
Solomonic Alchemy Level 5
Alteration: Slight, Ritual
The sahir mixes a pawn of vis and a 
cubic pace of sand, and changes it into a 
pool of clear spring water, enough to fill 
several large barrels. This transformation 
only lasts as long as the spirit maintains 
the effect, though the ritual nature of 
the spell ensures that the water will still 
quench thirst if drunk before it changes 
back. Note, however, that characters 
with Magic Resistance cannot swallow 
this water unless the effect penetrates 
their defenses.
(This is a Slight change, because the 
water produced is perfectly natural, and 
quite commonly found in this form.)
(Base 5)
Cracks in the earth,  
[Spirit] weakens the ground
Solomonic Alchemy Level 10
Alteration: Substantial
With this spell, the sahir diminishes 
the cold, cohesive property of earth, caus-
ing a single rock or a circle of stone three 
feet in diameter to crumble into chunks of 
dirt and dust.
(Base 4, +2 Substantial)
Summon forth the purest flame, 
to set alight those who oppose us
Solomonic Alchemy Level 15
Alteration: Major
The sahir takes a barely inflammable 
object like a damp cloth or a piece of 
wood coated with pitch, and lights the 
end of it. This spell changes the fire into 
a bright blue flame that burns hotter than 
even molten iron. This flame lasts until it 
runs out of fuel, can ignite things like flesh 
or wet thatch that are otherwise extremely 
resistant to fire, and causes +20 Damage 
to anyone that comes into direct contact 
with it.
(Base 4, +3 Major)
The wind is my armor,  
my armor is the wind
Solomonic Alchemy Level 15
Alteration: Slight, Ritual
When preparing for a long journey, 
the sahir casts this spell upon his mail 
hauberk. This costs three pawns of vis 
and transforms the heavy, worked metal 
into light, spun threads of cloth for the 
duration of the effect. The sahir typically 
instructs his spirit to drop the effect just 
before he goes into battle, which also frees 
the spirit to focus on other spells while the 
sahir is fighting.
Since the Alteration parameter is 
Slight, the cloth that this spell produces 
is somewhat fragile and looks like woven 
chain links, but can be worn beneath a 
traveling cloak or gown. Increasing Al-
teration to Minor lets the sahir change the 
cut and look of the armor into something 
more fashionable, and Substantial allows 
him to change it into a completely dif-
ferent sort of garment. Another common 
variation is to add a magnitude of size to 
affect the barding on his horse.

Solomonic Alchemy Guidelines
These guidelines distinguish be-
tween changes to principle qualities 
(hot, cold, dry, or moist) and second-
ary qualities (things like acidity, density, 
weight, or color) of matter.
Ritual alchemy effects can be held 
dormant until the sahir or the spirit trig-
gers them by concentrating upon them, 
for as long as the spirit maintains the ef-
fect, and may be transferred from one 
appropriate target to another as long 
as the effect is still active and the new 
target is touching the former target, 
the sahir, or the spirit (Finesse rolls are 
required if the new target is not clearly 
part of the original target). Animated 
objects will move under the sahir’s con-
trol if he concentrates upon them, but 
he must make Finesse rolls for more fo-
cused manipulation. 
Unlike basic Alchemy spells that 
bring about natural changes to the sub-
stance of the target, spells that use ritual 
guidelines produce a magical substance 
that for the duration cannot directly af-
fect anyone with Magic Resistance un-
less the spell Penetrates.

The Cradle & The Crescent
enters battle, he sends forth his guardian 
angel to touch the armor of one of his 
unsuspecting opponents, and then (with 
a successful Finesse roll) he transfers the 
effect to his armor instead, restoring his 
own protection and leaving his enemy 
suddenly vulnerable.
(Base 10, +1 size)
Bear me upon breath of stone
Solomonic Alchemy Level 20
Alteration: Minor, Ritual
The sahir lights a bonfire that pro-
duces a great deal of smoke, and after he 
sacrifices the necessary pawns of vis, the 
gray clouds become as solid as stone, able 
to support the weight of a man. The sahir 
may then step onto these unnatural floes 
and rise into the air, or perhaps climb 
down them if he moves quickly, as long as 
the spirit maintains the spell and the fire 
continues to produce smoke.
(This is a “noticeable” transformation, 
altering the ability of the smoke to bear 
weight to correspond to that of stone. A 
Substantial alteration might alter several 
properties of the smoke at once, perhaps 
making a cloud cohesive and enduring 
enough to support a structure, or cause the 
smoke to become cold and slippery as well 
as solid.)
(Base 15, +1 Minor)
What Jabir found inside the rock
Solomonic Alchemy Level 20
Alteration: Major
This spell improves the quality of a 
precious or semi-precious gem, dramati-
cally increasing its value. In addition, the 
Shape and Material bonus that the stone 
imparts when used with Hermetic magic 
increases by 3. For example, an emerald 
purified by this spell would give a +10 bo-
nus to magic that affects snakes and drag-
onkind, instead of a +7 bonus. Any given 
stone can only be affected once with this 
effect; it is impossible to naturally purify 
it further.
Sahirs are not supposed to trade 
“magic things” to people who do not be-
long to the Suhhar, but the exchange of 
gemstones that have been enhanced with 
this spell has so far gone unnoticed at Ma-
jlis. Perhaps this is because those of the 
Ashab al-Qalb who use it do so sparingly 
enough that it has not come to the atten-
tion of the viziers, or perhaps it is because 
enchantment bonus does not benefit the 
sahirs’ magic in any way, and thus they 
do not realize why magi especially value 
these stones.
(Base 5, +3 Major)
Rain of heavenly fire
Solomonic Alchemy Level 30
Alteration: Substantial, Ritual
The sahir casts the spell while his cast-
ing spirit is close enough to see and hear 
him, and since it is a ritual he can then 
hold it dormant while the spirit flies into 
a thunderstorm. Then, through the spirit, 
he transforms the rain into searing bolts of 
flame that cause +10 Damage to anyone 
caught beneath them without Magic Re-
sistance. This rain is hot enough to ignite 
buildings, trees, and other things made of 
wood, and these new fires are not extin-
guished when the effect ends. The storm 
will continue to rain fire for as long as the 
spirit concentrates, or until the storm nat-
urally abates.
Members of the Suhhar can usually 
recognize this spell by the way it leaves 
behind soaking wet rubble when the 
flames transform back into rain.
(Base 5, +2 Substantial, +3 size)
The vigilant guardian
Solomonic Alchemy Level 30
Alteration: Major, Ritual
With this spell, the sahir animates a 
stone statue of up to 10 cubic feet in size 
(roughly the size of a very large man), 
which follows his directions whenever 
he concentrates, for as long as the spirit 
maintains the effect. The statue can 
slowly move and bend its limbs as if 
they were made of clay, though they re-
main as hard and impenetrable as stone. 
It can even change its shape, flowing 
like mud or sand to spread out across a 
surface, though it will naturally attempt 
to return to its original form whenever 
the sahir releases control of it or when 
the spell ends. (These changes are Ma-
jor alterations.)

The wondrous box of Al-Fazari
Solomonic Alchemy Level 35
Alteration: Minor, Ritual
The sahir touches an object that is 
about 50,000 cubic inches in size, such as 
a large chest or basket, and spends seven 
pawns of vis. The object and everything it 
contains grows or shrinks by a factor of ten 
(the equivalent of three Size categories), 
and remains that size for as long as the spir-
it maintains the effect. An animal of Size 0 
placed inside the box could grow to Size +3 
(the size of a very large horse), or shrink to 
become Size –3 (the size of a cat).
(Base 5, +3 Major, +3 size)
Solomonic Astrology
Astrological effects impart informa-
tion directly to the sahir through his rec-
ognition of signs and portents, and can 
thus target any individual the sahir can see 
or to which he has an Arcane Connection. 
These effects have a single parameter, 
Detail, which describes the quality of in-
formation gleaned from the spell, though 
questions about the past or the distant 
future add an additional magnitude, and 
those about the near future (within a 
month) add two magnitudes.
Some ritual spell effects give the sahir 
the ability to sense danger, similar to the 
Premonitions Supernatural Ability. When 
this effect is active, the storyguide should 
apply a Premonition bonus to any roll 
where the outcome would make the predic-
tion false, and reduce the number of botch 
dice for these rolls by the same amount. The 
base value of this bonus is noted next to the 
corresponding guideline, and increases with 
the Detail parameter, as indicated later.
Binary: A one-word answer between two 
choices. (+0 magnitudes)
Basic: The equivalent of a three-word an-
swer. This adds a +1 bonus to premo-
nition effects. (+1 magnitude)
Brief: A single sentence of information. 
This adds a +2 bonus to premonition 
effects. (+2 magnitudes)
Thorough: All relevant information as-
sociated with the target. This adds a 
+3 bonus to premonition effects. (+3 
magnitudes)

Answers provided by Solomonic As-
trology are not absolute, especially when 
they involve the future, though they do 
provide indicators that sahirs can interpret 
to receive clear answers to specific ques-
tions. For more guidance on the sorts of 
results that astrological calculations tend 
to provide, see Art & Academe, page 74.
When used with Artes Liberales to 
disguise or augment his casting, the sahir 
must make up an astrological chart for the 
target. This requires knowledge of the 
date and place of its birth, and an Intel-
ligence + Artes Liberales roll against an 
Ease Factor of 9.
Art & Academe has more examples of as-

The blessed day, the apt day
Solomonic Astrology General
Detail: Basic, Ritual
The sahir consults the heavens regard-
ing a particular course of action taken by 
his target, and calculates a date and ap-
proximate time during the next month in 
which the endeavor will be most likely to 
succeed, and the consequences least disas-
trous should he fail. At Level 30, this trans-
lates to a +1 bonus (and one fewer botch 
die) on any rolls associated with the activ-
ity, so long as that activity is performed at 
the appointed hour and day. This bonus 
increases with each additional magnitude, 
so at Level 35 it is a +2 bonus, +3 at Level 
40, and so on.
Sahirs do not generally rely on this 
spell for spellcasting, since it is expensive 
in terms of vis and it is usually more cost-ef-
fective to spend the vis on the spell directly. 
For many non-magical activities or circum-
stances expected to be particularly danger-
Solomonic Astrology Guidelines
All Solomonic Astrology ritual spells 
increase the Penetration of the sahir’s 
magic by the effect level when casting 
subsequent spells against that same tar-
get, as long as the Solomonic Astrology 
ritual itself Penetrates. This bonus only 
lasts while the spirit maintains the ef-
fect, and requires the sahir to make a Fi-
nesse roll if he is casting the second spell 
through the same spirit.
General: Receive a premonition regard-
ing auspicious influences for a par-
ticular action. The bonus the target 
receives is equal to (the magnitude of 
this effect – 3), and cannot be nega-
tive. (Ritual)
Level 2: Perceive one obvious property 
of a person or object (e.g., hair color, 
current activity).
Level 3: Perceive one property of a per-
son or object that can be determined 
from close examination (e.g., state of 
consciousness, age).
Level 4: Perceive a specific piece of in-
formation about a person or object 
that cannot normally be determined 
without an appropriate Ability (e.g., 
emotional state, maker of an object).
	
Perceive one obvious property of 
a person’s or object’s surroundings 
(e.g., time of day, sounds). (Ritual)
Level 5: Sense complex information 
about a person or object that would 
normally require extended use of an 
Ability (e.g., the truth of a statement, 
all mundane properties of an object).
	
Perceive one property of a person’s or 
object’s surroundings that can be de-
termined from close examination (e.g., 
climate, prosperity level). (Ritual)
	
Receive a premonition regarding 
mortal peril to a person or object (+2 
bonus). (Ritual)
	
Create a temporary Arcane Connec-
tion to the target, with connection 
strength equal to (the magnitude of 
the Detail parameter + 1). (Ritual)
Level 10: Perceive a specific piece of in-
formation about a person’s or object’s 
surroundings that cannot normally be 
determined without an appropriate 
Ability (e.g., a companion’s health, a 
supernatural aura). (Ritual)
	
Receive a premonition regarding 
danger to a person or object (+1 bo-
nus). (Ritual)
Level 15: Perceive complex information 
about a person’s or object’s surround-
ings that would normally require 
extended use of an Ability (e.g., all 
nearby animals, what others think of 
that person) (Ritual)
	
Receive a premonition regarding an 
inconvenience to a person or object

The Cradle & The Crescent
ous, however, the preparation of this spell is 
considered to be exceptionally wise, and its 
judicious application is highly favored by 
the members of the Ashab al-Najm.
(Base effect, +1 Basic, +2 immediate 
future)
The picture of [Target]
Solomonic Astrology Level 5
Detail: Binary, Ritual
This spell creates a temporary Arcane 
Connection between an object held by 
the caster and the target, which costs a 
single pawn of vis and only lasts as long 
as the spirit maintains the effect. This Ar-
cane Connection is equivalent in strength 
to one that lasts hours or days (giving a +1 
bonus to the Penetration multiplier), and 
as a side effect of casting a ritual spell, for 
the duration this naranj also gives the sa-
hir a +5 bonus to his Penetration Total for 
subsequent spells cast at that target.
When the duration of the effect ends, 
the Arcane Connection immediately fades. 
Until then, it is a normal and natural Ar-
cane Connection, and thus it can be made 
permanent in the laboratory with a season 
of effort and a pawn of vis.
(Base 5)
What is the state  
of [Target]’s health?
Solomonic Astrology Level 5
Detail: Brief
This spell tells the sahir whether the tar-
get inclines more towards life or death, and 
in what way, through a short sentence. For 
example, “He is alive, very badly burned, 
disfigured, unconscious, and incapacitated.”
If the target has Magic Resistance, this 
effect must Penetrate to provide an an-
swer. Many sahirs cast low-level Astrology 
naranjs like this one as ritual spells for the 
bonus to their Penetration Total. For this 
spell, this costs the sahir a pawn of vis and 
gives him a +5 bonus to subsequent spells 
cast on that target.
(Base 3, +2 Brief)
Is [Target] a spirit?
Solomonic Astrology Level 10
Detail: Brief
This spell tells the sahir if his target is 
a spirit or not, and if so, what type of spirit 
and approximately how powerful it is (e.g., 
“a weak faerie spirit, with less than 10 Fa-
erie Might” or “a powerful spirit with Magic 
Might 30 or more”). Note that if the spirit 
is Infernal, this spell typically gives a false 
reading. Since an object with a spirit bound 
to it is an Arcane Connection to that spirit, 
this spell can effectively tell the sahir if a 
given object is a Solomonic device.
(Base 4, +2 Brief)
Where is [Target]  
at this moment?
Solomonic Astrology Level 10
Detail: Brief
The sahir concentrates upon his ques-
tion (and perhaps draws a horoscope for 
the target, adding half an hour to the cast-
ing time and his Artes Liberales to the 
Casting Total), and learns the target’s cur-
rent location, within a describable region 
and in relation to a particular feature, such 
as “south of the city of Baghdad, within an 
ancient stone structure.” This should be 
information that a person familiar with the 
surrounding area could recognize based 
on landmarks, local legends, and the like.
(Base 4, +2 Brief)
What are the words  
that surround [Target]?
Solomonic Astrology Level 15
Detail: Thorough, Ritual
The sahir concentrates upon his tar-
get, and for as long as his spirit keeps the 
effect active, he can hear all sounds in the 
target’s presence. The sahir is not actu-
ally there, of course, so he is not affected 
by magic that targets those in the area, 
which makes this effect ideal for intelli-
gence gathering.
(Base 4, +3 Thorough)
Hearing the heart’s speech
Solomonic Astrology Level 20
Detail: Thorough
By reading all of the auspices surround-
ing his target’s circumstances, the sahir can 
understand fully what his target is express-
ing, allowing him to make sense of words 
that are otherwise unfamiliar for a single 
exchange. If cast as a ritual spell with four 
pawns of vis, the duration can be extended 
indefinitely, allowing the sahir to compre-
hend his target’s speech for as long as the 
spirit maintains the effect. If the target has 
Magic Resistance, the spell fails unless the 
sahir Penetrates it.
There is a fairly common version 
of this spell invented by a sahir named 
Dawud al-Malik al-Najm that, as a side 
effect of experimentation, also includes 
the target’s understanding of any words 
spoken by the sahir. This variation can be 
found throughout the Suhhar but requires 
at least rudimentary knowledge of Solo-
monic Storytelling to learn.
(Base 5, +3 Thorough)
What do [Target]’s  
enemies intend?
Solomonic Astrology Level 25
Detail: Brief, Ritual
This ritual spell costs five pawns of vis 
and gives the sahir a premonition about any 
sort of social danger to his target, related to 
an immediate situation such as Majlis or a 
meeting with an important person. The sto-
ryguide decides if and how the target will 
be inconvenienced at the event, and an-
swers with a short sentence to describe the 
circumstances. For example, “a rival intends 
to challenge you to a storytelling duel.” This 
also gives the player a +2 bonus towards all 
actions that support the accuracy of the 
premonition; that is, those rolls to affect 
whether he is inconvenienced or not. In this 
example, the sahir would likely gain the bo-
nus to rolls during the duel and actions lead-
ing up to the duel, but not to rolls where he 
attempts to avoid the duel or where he tries 
to deal with his enemy in other ways.
(Base 15, +2 Brief)
When and where  
was [Target] born?
Solomonic Astrology Level 25
Detail: Thorough
When the sahir does not know the 
date or location of his target’s birth, he 
may use this spell to divine it — though 
not, of course, while using Artes Liberales 
to boost the casting, since this is precisely 
the information he needs to draw the tar-
get’s horoscope.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Will [Target] survive  
tomorrow’s battle?
Solomonic Astrology Level 30
Detail: Thorough, Ritual
This spell gives the sahir a premonition 
concerning his target’s chances against mor-
tal peril in his near future. The storyguide 
considers the question, and then outlines 
the conditions for the sahir’s player in gen-
eral terms. For example, “He is not a skilled 
warrior but he wears good armor, so he is 
likely to prevail,” or “He is too reckless, 
and if he charges into battle as he is usually 
wont to do, he will surely be killed.” 
Mechanically, this translates to a +5 
bonus (+3 for Thorough, +2 for “mortal 
peril”) to all rolls that would gainsay this 
outcome were they to fail (such as the 
target’s Defense rolls in the first case, or 
his enemies’ Attack rolls if he charges into 
battle in the second case).
(Base 5, +3 Thorough, +2 near future)
Solomonic Physic
To affect a target with Solomonic 
Physic, the sahir or the spirit must touch 
it during the round he casts the naranj. 
He can affect animals as easily as humans, 
though they do require separate spells, 
and as long as a naranj targets an indi-
vidual person or creature, its size does not 
matter; a giant or dwarf can be affected as 
easily as a normal man.
Physic effects have one parameter, Po-
tency, which determines the strength of 
the effect. Many of these effects can injure 
as easily as heal.
Weak: Affect pain or other symptoms of 
injury or disease, minor aging crises, 
Winded Fatigue levels, or Characteris-
tics or Personality Traits with scores of 
up to +1 or –1. (+0 magnitudes)
Mild: Affect Light Wounds, Minor Diseas-
es, serious aging crises, Weary Fatigue 
levels, or Characteristics or Personal-
ity Traits with scores of up to +2 or –2. 
(+1 magnitude)
Moderate: Affect Medium Wounds, Seri-
ous Diseases, major aging crises, Tired 
Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or 
Personality Traits with scores of up to 
+3 or –3. (+2 magnitudes)
Solomonic Physic Guidelines
All active Solomonic Physic ritual 
spells also either protect the patient 
against the penalties for that particular 
type of wound, disease, or level of fa-
tigue; or they prevent that wound, dis-
ease or fatigue from healing, for as long 
as the spirit maintains the effect. 
Also, for the duration, ritual spells 
may be delayed like with Solomonic Al-
chemy: they can be held dormant until 
the sahir or the spirit releases them by 
touching the target.
General: Modify the target’s next 
Wound Recovery roll by (3 x (the 
effect’s magnitude + 2)). Use this 
general guideline for effects Base 
Level 5 or greater.
	
Modify the target’s next Disease Re-
covery roll by (3 x (the effect’s magni-
tude + 2)) against diseases of a certain 
humor. Use this general guideline for 
effects Base Level 5 or greater.
	
Cause a wound if the target fails a 
Stamina roll against an Ease Factor 
of (3 x (the effect’s magnitude + 2)). 
Use this general guideline for effects 
Base Level 5 or greater.
	
Increase or decrease a Personality 
Trait associated with one of the four 
humors by a number of points equal 
to (the magnitude of this effect + 1), 
up to the maximum established by 
the Potency parameter. (Ritual)
	
Increase one of a person’s Charac-
teristics for the effect’s duration by 
a number of points equal to (the 
magnitude of this effect – 3), up to 
the maximum established by the Po-
tency parameter. (Ritual)
	
Decrease one of a person’s Charac-

Level 2: Modify the target’s next Wound 
Recovery roll by 1.
	
Modify the target’s next Disease Re-
covery roll against diseases of a cer-
tain humor by 1.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Strong: Affect Heavy Wounds, Major 
Diseases, critical aging crises, Dazed 
Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or 
Personality Traits with scores of up to 
+4 or –4. (+3 magnitudes)
Mighty: Affect Incapacitating Wounds, 
Critical Diseases, terminal aging crises, 
Unconscious Fatigue levels, or Charac-
teristics or Personality Traits with scores 
of up to +5 or –5. (+4 magnitudes)
For effects that grant either a bonus or 
a penalty, the choice is made during cast-
ing; the naranj as designed can do both. 
Since many of these effects involve a bo-
nus or penalty to the target’s next Recov-
ery roll, it may be possible to recognize 
how the patient is doing before then.
When disguising or supplementing his 
magic with Medicine, the sahir must admin-
ister herbs and other ingredients typically 
supplied by an apothecary, much like sahirs 
performing Solomonic Alchemy. With no 
access to these materials, the sahir must al-
ways use arcane gestures and words.
Additional examples of medicinal ef-
fects that sahirs can duplicate with magic 
may be found in Art and Academe.
Solomonic Physic  
Spell Formulas
The spells given here are specially de-
signed for Solomonic Physic.
Balm of the barmakids
Solomonic Physic General
Potency: Mild
The target receives a bonus (or pen-
alty) to his next Recovery roll for a Light 
Wound, which varies depending on the 
base level of this effect. At Level 5 this 
modifies the roll by 6, at Level 10 the 
modifier is 9, and at Level 15 the bonus or 
penalty is 12.
(Base effect, +1 Mild)
Strings of the sanguine heart
Solomonic Physic General
Potency: Moderate, Ritual
This ritual affects the blood of the 
target, altering the sanguine humors and 
influencing the target’s behavior. For the 
duration of the effect, the target has his 
Sanguine Personality Trait increased or de-
creased by the magnitude of this spell – 1, 
to a maximum value of +3 or –3. At Level 
20, this is a change of three points. If the 
target does not have a Sanguine Trait or a 
similar Trait such as Carefree or Optimistic, 
he gains one for the duration of the effect.
When casting this spell while incor-
porating principles of Medicine, the sa-
hir typically feeds the target red meat or 
strong wine fortified with animal blood 
before performing the ritual.
(Base effect, +2 Moderate)
Rend his flesh and tear his organs
Solomonic Physic General
Potency: Moderate
The target is poisoned internally and 
suffers a medium wound unless he makes a 
Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 0 for 
a Level 4 spell, or three times the magni-
tude of the spell for Level 5 or more. For 
example, at Level 20, the Ease Factor is 12.
If cast as a ritual spell, the effect can 
be held dormant by the spirit and released 
at an ideal time, and unless the target re-
sists it, he cannot heal this wound natu-
rally for as long as the spirit maintains 
concentration.
(Base effect, +2 Moderate)
[Spirit] sits on the fever’s edge
Solomonic Physic General
Potency: Strong
This spell helps or hinders the target’s 
recovery from a major disease or lesser 
severity that affects the blood. It modifies 
his Recovery roll by 1 for a Level 5 spell, 3 
for a Level 10 spell, or (3 x (the magnitude 
of the spell – 1)) for a spell Level 15 or 
more. For example, a Level 15 spell would 
add or subtract 6.
Magos al-Laqis al-Abyad al-Sakhr 
causes his patient to briefly feel complete-
ly at peace whenever he casts this spell 
through his guardian angel.
(Base effect, +3 Strong)
Insight of the ancient jinn
Solomonic Physic, General
Potency: Weak, Ritual
The target’s Perception temporar-
ily increases by a number of points equal 
to (the magnitude of this effect – 3), up 
to a maximum score of +1, and he can-
not have his Perception reduced by other 
spells. This effect only lasts as long as 
the spirit maintains it. At Level 20, this 
increases Perception 0 to Perception +1, 
and at Level 35 this increases Perception 
–3 to +1.
(Base effect)
The hollowing curse
Solomonic Physic, General
Potency: Mighty, Ritual
The target of this devastating spell 
has his Stamina reduced by (its magnitude 
– 7), to a minimum of –5, for the duration 
of the effect. For example, at Level 60, a 
target with Stamina +1 will be temporar-
ily reduced five points to Stamina –4. Fur-
thermore, the target cannot increase his 
Stamina through any means during this 
time, even through Al-Iksir potions or 
other Solomonic Physic rituals, and gains 
a Warping Point every season it is active 
plus an additional Warping Point when it 
is cast.
It is said that the Ashab al-Yad prefer 
not to murder their enemies (all sahirs are 
still answerable to their earthly authori-
ties, after all), but instead punish them 
in other ways, such as with this spell, 
which makes the target especially vul-
nerable to accidents and illnesses. Also, 
unlike death, this effect can be undone, 
if necessary.
(Base effect, +4 Mighty)
Siphoning the warrior’s bile
Solomonic Physic Level 15
Potency: Moderate, Ritual
By touching his target and spending 
three pawns of vis, the sahir casts a spell 
that transforms the target’s Brave Trait 
into a different Trait for the spell’s dura-
tion, chosen when this spell is cast. The 
spell can affect similar Traits like Coura-
geous, or opposing Traits like Cowardly, 
but only Traits with scores of up to +3 
or –3 may be affected. The new Trait 
should be similarly positive or negative, 
e.g., Brave to Loyal or Kind, Cowardly to 
Prideful or Envious.
(Base 5, +2 Moderate)

The Cradle & The Crescent
[Spirit], let me lean upon you
Solomonic Physic Level 25
Potency: Mighty
The sahir restores a Fatigue Level to 
his target, even when unconscious. If cast 
as a ritual spell, the target suffers no pen-
alty for lost fatigue for as long as the spirit 
maintains the effect, though the target can 
still fall unconscious from exhaustion.
Many sahirs cast this on themselves as 
a ritual spell, instructing the spirit to hold 
the effect dormant until they pass out, to 
revive themselves as quickly as possible.
(Base 5, +4 Mighty)
Close the red wounds of war
Solomonic Physic Level 30
Potency: Mighty, Ritual
This spell immediately heals any one 
Incapacitating, Heavy, Medium, or Light 
Wound caused by damage that cuts or pierc-
es the body. The spell takes about an hour 
and a half to cast, and requires six pawns of 
vis. It also gives the target a Warping Point 
for a powerful mystical effect unless it has 
been specifically designed for him.
Because it is a ritual spell, for as long as 
the spirit maintains the effect, the penalty 
from all other wounds the patient sustains 
is reduced by 7.
(Base 10, +4 Mighty)
Jabril’s blessing
Solomonic Physic Level 40
Potency: Mighty, Ritual
This spell immediately resolves any 
illness caused by an aging crisis. The pa-
tient will fully recover after about a season, 
though for as long as the spirit maintains the 
effect, the patient suffers no ill effects from 
the crisis and may continue as normal.
(Base 20, +4 Mighty)
Solomonic Storytelling
Solomonic Storytelling spells affect 
“an audience,” which is essentially any 
and all targets within range of the sahir’s 
voice. As with Hermetic magic, the sahir 
must be able to perceive everyone tar-
geted by the naranj at the time of cast-
ing in order to affect them, though some 
ritual spells create illusions that can affect 
anyone who comes upon them after they 
have been cast.
Those who are targeted by Storytell-
ing effects have a chance to see through 
them, and so they have an Allure param-
eter that determines how difficult they 
are to resist. Also, Solomonic Storytelling 
does not circumvent Magic Resistance, so 
when characters with Magic Resistance 
are targeted, the storyguide should check 
for Penetration first.
Simple: The target sees through the ef-
fect with a Perception + Awareness 
against an Ease Factor of 6, made when 
the subject first encounters the effect. 
(+0 magnitudes)
Emotional: The target resists the effect with 
a Perception die roll plus or minus a Per-
sonality Trait that suggests whether or 
not he would question the effect, against 
an Ease Factor of 6. For example, Brave 
and Loyal would probably subtract from 
the die roll. (+1 magnitudes)
Unsuspecting: An intelligent target may 
see through the effect if his suspicions 
are raised. Once the target is skepti-
cal, this is a Perception + Guile roll 
against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist. 
(+2 magnitudes)
Supernatural: Only targets with supernat-
ural perception, such as Second Sight 
or Solomonic Travel ritual spells, may 
see through the effect. The Percep-
tion + (Ability) roll has an Ease Factor 
of 6. (+3 magnitudes)
Storytelling effects are always sus-
ceptible to the parameters with higher 
magnitude as well as the value they are 
designed to use, so that a suspicious per-
son with Second Sight would have three 
chances to see through an effect with 
Emotional Allure. While designing the 
spell, the sahir may also add a magnitude 
to the spell level to increase the Ease Fac-
tor for any of these Perception checks by 
3. For example, three additional magni-
tudes would increase all four Ease Factors 
from 6 to 15.
When disguising or augmenting a Sto-
rytelling spell using (Area) Lore, the sahir 
must have an audience, and must hold this 
audience’s attention, making a Commu-
nication + (Area) Lore roll. Here, (Area) 
Lore represents the sahir’s ability to recall 
and relate an appropriate story. It also rep-
resents his ability to conjure images and 
emotions that match the local culture and 
his surroundings. The difficulty of this roll 
varies depending upon the audience and

the circumstances; Ease Factor 3 might be 
appropriate for a group relaxing around 
a fire, 15 for a hostile group blocking his 
way. At the players’ discretion, Free Ex-
pression or similar Virtues give the char-
acter a +3 bonus on this roll.
Some Storytelling ritual spells pro-
duce what might be called “mental spe-
cies.” These affect the mind directly, 
creating illusions of perception that are 
solid and in all senses real for anyone 
who does not resist them. An illusion of 
flames is not actually hot, and an illusory 
ceiling does not actually keep out the 
weather, but the illusion masks outward 
signs so that those affected simply do 
not perceive them. A guest in an illusory 
house might become suspicious when he 
still has a chill after sitting by the fire, 
or when he feels rain falling despite the 
thick roof above him.

The tongue has no bone,

Solomonic Storytelling Level 5
Allure: Emotional
The sahir casts this naranj at his audi-
ence, causing those affected to feel pro-
found embarrassment, as if they had just 
done something terribly improper. A hum-
ble person has a greater chance of seeing 
through this illusion, adding his Personal-

Solomonic Storytelling Level 5
Allure: Simple, Ritual
The target’s image is changed to appear 
as a skeleton, with all of his flesh removed, 
for as long as the spirit maintains the ef-
fect. This illusion may be pierced with a 
Perception roll against an Ease Factor of

to punish sahirs who offend them in some 
way, making it even more difficult for their 
victims to interact with mundane society. 
It is common for the effect to manifest as a 
fierce wind blowing from the mouth of the 
sahir pronouncing the curse, stripping the 
meat from the target’s frame.

Solomonic Storytelling Level 10
Allure: Simple
With this naranj, the sahir convinces a 
weak-minded audience to obey an innocu-

daughter is lost” or “that man is an im-
poster.” Anyone affected may make a Per-
ception + Awareness roll against an Ease 
Factor of 12 to resist the effect, but suc-
cess means they do not understand the 
underlying message.
If cast as a ritual spell, the sahir may 
continue to communicate short phrases 
in this way each subsequent round, for as 
long as the spirit maintains the spell, and 
may include newcomers into the effect by 
concentrating upon them for a round.

Solomonic Storytelling Level 15
Allure: Supernatural
All those within range of the sahir’s 
voice are lulled to sleep unless they have 
supernatural perception, in which case 
they may shake off the effect with a Per-
ception + (Ability) roll against an Ease 
Factor of 6. They may easily wake again 
if they are disturbed; they will sleep as 
long as they would if they had fallen 
asleep naturally.
To add his Area Lore to his total, the

Solomonic Storytelling Level 15
Allure: Emotional
The sahir’s audience is inspired with a 
feeling of loyalty and cooperative enthu-
siasm, a strong desire to work together 
with others in their community. In effect, 
everyone who listens to the performance 
receives a +3 bonus to Personality rolls 
associated with working together, as if 
the caster had the Inspirational Virtue.

sion is 12.

Solomonic Storytelling Level 20
Allure: Supernatural, Ritual
This spell causes the sahir’s image to 
explode in a blinding flash of flame and 
then cease to be visible for the dura-
tion of the effect. Only those with some 
form of supernatural perception can see 
through this illusion at Ease Factor 6, 
though anyone in the sahir’s audience 
with Magic Resistance is unaffected un-
less the spell penetrates.
(Base 5, +3 Supernatural)
You will not remember  
me when I am gone
Solomonic Storytelling Level 20
Allure: Unsuspecting
Through his performance, the sa-
hir causes his audience to remember a 
completely different event happening 
instead, the details of which are woven 
into the naranj. For example, he might 
have them recall that they watched the 
sun set, or listened to an imam give a 
moving speech about the merits of chil-
dren obeying their parents. Once the 
spell is cast, the sahir’s audience might be 
briefly disoriented, as they try to remem-
ber what it is that they are doing. If the 
facts of this story are called into ques-
tion, a successful Perception + Guile roll 
against an Ease Factor of 6 allows them 
to remember the truth.
(Base 10, +2 Unsuspecting)
Sow the seeds for  
a crop of betrayers
Solomonic Storytelling Level 25
Allure: Unsuspecting
The sahir convinces his audience to 
perform a heinous act, specified at the 
time of casting, such as attacking each 
other, assaulting their leader, or burning 
down a mosque. Those who suspect they 
have been enchanted may make a Percep-
tion + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 
9 to resist, otherwise they act as if they 
had decided on the action themselves, and 
proceed to carry out the command to the 
best of their abilities.
If they are prevented from fulfilling 
their orders, the desire to comply will fade 
over time, more or less quickly depending 
upon the mental state of the targets. Gen-
erally, the targets recover from the effect 
at about the same time they would wake 
if they fell asleep. If cast as a Ritual spell 
and maintained by a spirit, however, the 
effects endure and the sahir can suppress, 
restore, or even change the command by 
concentrating on the target.
(Base 10, +2 Unsuspecting, +1 Ease 
Factor)
[Spirit]’s cave
Solomonic Storytelling Level 30
Allure: Unsuspecting, Ritual
This ritual spell creates the illusion of 
a tall, hollow hill or dune, large enough 
to contain about a hundred people, their 
animals, and tents. This takes approxi-
mately an hour and a half, and costs the 
sahir six pawns of vis. Once the naranj is 
cast, the sahir and the people inside can 
see through the image if they make a Per-
ception + Guile roll against an Ease Factor 
of 6, or the sahir can selectively drop the 
illusion for any of them by concentrating 
on the effect. This allows the people in-
side to watch others who approach with 
ease, most of whom will have no reason to 
doubt the image and almost certainly will 
travel around it, creating a perfect ambush 
site or hiding place. The illusion lasts for 
as long as the spirit maintains the effect, or 
until the sahir cancels it.
(Base 20, +2 Unsuspecting)
Solomonic Travel
Solomonic Travel involves manipu-
lating the power of the four supernatu-
ral realms. These spells open a passage 
through an individual target, which the 
sahir must draw upon or mark in some 
way; or else through a circle that he draws 
upon the ground or on a solid surface such 
as a wall or floor. To allow others to travel 
through this passage, the marked target or 
circle must be large enough for each indi-
vidual to pass through it.
These effects have one parameter, De-
lay, which determines how long the sahir 
must wait for the effect to manifest. The 
markings or circle that he draws on the tar-
get must remain undisturbed until this time.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Season: The effect manifests at the next 
solstice or equinox. (+0 magnitudes)
Moon: The effect manifests during the next 
full or new moon. (+1 magnitude)
Sun: The effect manifests at the next dawn 
or dusk. (+2 magnitudes)
Immediate: The effect manifests immedi-
ately. (+3 magnitudes)
The sahir can perform a mystic cer-
emony to augment his Casting Total, or 
to disguise his casting. This requires him 
to have a (Realm) Lore score of at least 3 
(of the realm appropriate to the effect), 
consume special materials appropriate to 
the realm (e.g., candles, incense, offer-
ings, sacrifices, etc.), and he must describe 
the effect upon the target with pictures or 
words. For example, a divine ceremony 
might require the burning of white candles 
and sweet incense while chanting appro-
priate passages of the Qur’an and inscrib-
ing them on the target.

Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Immediate
This effect causes an individual tar-
get that the sahir touches to immediately 
gain two Warping Points, unless the target 
makes a Stamina roll against an Ease Fac-
tor equal to three times (the magnitude of 
the spell – 3). For example, a Level 25 ver-
sion has an Ease Factor of 6.

Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Immediate
This effect closes a passage that has 
been opened with Solomonic Travel or 
a similar power, even one that is being 
maintained by a spirit or which has been 
created but has not yet manifested. At 
Level 20, it can cancel another effect of 
up to Level 20. At Level 35, it can can-
cel another effect of up to Level 50. At 
Solomonic Travel Guidelines
Active Solomonic Travel ritual spells 
grant the sahir supernatural senses, al-
lowing him to see through illusions and 
perceive things that are imbued with su-
pernatural power. Treat this as scores in 
both Magic Sensitivity and Second Sight 
equal to the magnitude of the spell for as 
long as the spirit maintains it. This su-
pernatural sense is also affected by the 
Delay parameter, however, and does not 
actually manifest until the spell comes 
into effect, though the spirit must still 
maintain it until then.
A window or passage allows the sahir 
and anyone nearby to perceive species 
through it from another location, and al-
lows those on the other side to perceive 
the sahir’s location as well. These portals 
remain open as long as the spirit maintains 
the effect, and travel through a passage 
can be selectively granted or revoked to 
others by the spirit or as the sahir directs.
General: Give the target a Warping 
Point if it fails a Stamina roll against 
an Ease Factor of (3 x (the spell’s base 
magnitude + 1)). Additional magni-
tudes can also increase the number of 
Warping Points gained.
	
Restore a number of Might Points to 
a target equal to (the base level of the 
effect – 5).
	
Open a passage through a supernatu-
ral regio boundary of level no greater

Magic Realm of level no greater than 
the base magnitude of this effect (see 
Realms of Power: Magic, pages 21–26).
	
Open a passage into the Faerie Realm 
through a supernatural aura of level 
no less than (10 – (the base magni-
tude of this effect + 1)) (see Realms of 
Power: Faerie, pages 20–23).
	
Close a window or passage opened 
with Solomonic Travel or a similar 
power if the magnitude of the can-
celed effect is less than ((this spell’s

Open a passage from the Faerie 
Realm to a supernatural aura with an

(10 – (the base magnitude of this

Open a passage through a supernatu-
ral aura to another aura of the same

Level 10: Force the target to make an 
Aging roll.
Level 15: Open a passage into the Twi-
light Void (see Realms of Power: Magic, 
pages 23–26). (Ritual)
	
Open a window through an Arcane

The Cradle & The Crescent
Level 50, it can cancel another effect of 
up to Level 80. The sahir must mark the 
passageway he is closing in some way, 
usually by drawing the sign of the Ashab 
al-Nahr upon it with a piece of charred 
wood or ash.

Through the gray haze
Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Sun
At sunset or sunrise, the sahir opens pas-
sage through a regio boundary of level no 
greater than (the magnitude of this effect + 
3). For example, a Level 10 spell would open 
passage through a boundary of 5 or less.
While this naranj works on boundar-
ies aligned with any realm, the sahir may 
only incorporate his (Realm) Lore score if 
he correctly identifies the type of aura for 
the regio. If he guesses wrong, he receives 
no bonus.

Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Season
When cast from within a supernatural 
aura, this spell opens a passage into the Fa-
erie Realm (See Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 
20–23). As a Level 5 spell, the origin aura 
strength must be 10, with each additional 
magnitude lowering the minimum aura 
strength by 1.
(Base effect)
Warm as the life of day
Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Immediate
The sahir marks and concentrates 
upon a spirit or other supernatural being 
and restores a number of lost Might Points 
to its Might Pool. The number of Might 
Points it regains is equal to (the spell level 
– 20), so at Level 25 the target would re-
cover 5 Might Points. Note that the naranj 
must also penetrate the being’s Magic Re-
sistance to have its effect.
This naranj may be used to restore 
Might Points to the spirit through which 
it is cast. This is because the sahir is actu-
ally drawing upon the concentrated power 
of one of the four realms to replenish his 
target’s Might, not the spirit’s own power.

We will meet again  
as the seasons turn
Solomonic Travel General
Delay: Season, Ritual
From within a supernatural aura, the 
sahir draws the outline of a portal that will 
lead to a different aura of the same realm 
that he has visited before. The levels of 
both auras can be no less than (10 – the 
magnitude of this spell), which means 
that a Level 45 spell is needed to enable 
travel to or from a Level 1 aura. If both 
auras are at least Level 5, a Level 25 spell is 
sufficient. Most commonly, sahirs use this 
naranj to enable travel to the yearly Majlis, 
and cast it at the very end of spring so that 
they can use it during summer.
(Base effect)
Sight of many lifetimes
Solomonic Travel Level 25
Delay: Immediate
The target touched by the sahir is brief-
ly exposed to the harsh, timeless powers of 
one of the four supernatural realms, and 
must make an immediate Aging roll, even 
if the target is too young to require such 
rolls naturally. If the target is not living or 
is immortal, this naranj has no effect.
(Base 10, +3 Immediate)
The magical minaret
Solomonic Travel Level 30
Delay: Immediate, Ritual
The sahir draws upon the surface of a 
pool, the face of a rock, or a circle of sand, 
and once the ritual spell is complete he 
and any others he designates can perceive 
what is happening in a place to which he 
has an Arcane Connection. This super-
natural perception goes both ways, so that 
others near the target can also see and hear 
the sahir and his companions, though it is 
clear who is actually there and who is on 
the other side. Those on either side of the 
magical window can even cast spells and 
use their powers through it. The window 
only remains open as long as the sahir’s

spirit maintains the effect, however.
As this is a ritual spell, the sahir can 
open and close the window by concentrat-
ing, even selectively allowing or denying 
access to several at once. In addition, after 
the window opens the sahir gains super-
natural senses equivalent to scores of 6 in 
Second Sight and Magic Sensitivity for as 
long as the effect lasts.
(Base 15, +3 Immediate)
By the light of the ominous moon
Solomonic Travel Level 30
Delay: Moon, Ritual
Like other Solomonic Travel spells, 
the sahir draws the doorway through 
which he will gain passage, and once the 
moon changes he and his companions step 
through this doorway into what sahirs call 
“the spirit realm.” They pass through the 
doorway, yet once they reach the other 
side they are now insubstantial and in-
visible to other mortals, like a spirit, and 
mostly unable to affect them, physically or 
with their magic. They are also tangible 
to other spirits: they are able to see and 
interact with each other as if they were 
corporeal. Spirits who travel through the 
doorway experience just the opposite; 
they become physical and unable to in-
teract with the spirit world without appro-
priate powers. (See Realms of Power: Magic, 
page 100, for more on how spirits interact 
with the physical world.)
Sahirs generally circumvent the delay 
by casting the spell during a full moon.
(Base 25, +1 Moon)
The oubliette al-wazir
Solomonic Travel Level 45
Delay: Immediate, Ritual
This ritual spell opens passage to a 
particular location in the Magic Realm, 
without requiring travel through the 
Twilight Void (see Realms of Power: Magic, 
pages 21–23). It is said that the current 
grand vizier possesses an Arcane Con-
nection to a pit in the middle of a great 
stone fortress located in that realm, built 
on an island in the middle of a cold and 
lonely sea. Traitors to the Suhhar can be 
quietly exiled to this prison through the

Amongst us [jinn] are some that sub-
mit their wills and some that swerve from 
justice. Now those who submit their wills, 
they have sought out the path of right 
conduct: but those who swerve, they are 
fuel for Hell-fire.
	
— The Qur’an, Al-Jinn: 14-15
According to Islamic teaching, God 
created three classes of intelligent beings: 
the angels (mala’ika, sing., malak) made of 
light; the jinn (“the hidden,” masc. sing. 
jinni, fem. sing. jinniyya) made of smokeless 
fire or aether; and humans (al-Ins) made of 
clay. Angels are God’s direct servants at 
his side, while both humans and jinn are 
capable of salvation and were sent to pop-
ulate the earth. Muhammad was tasked 
with bringing both jinn and humans to 
salvation and many jinn appear to have 
adopted Islam, but there are also jinn who 
have devoted themselves to tempting oth-
ers and have rejected the message of the 
faith, risking damnation. It is said that the 
jinn were the original inhabitants of Earth 
but fell away from the worship of God. 
Iblis, the Islamic equivalent of the Devil, 
is recorded as being originally one of the 
most powerful of the ancient jinn. He fell 
to pride and refused to bow down to Adam 
when commanded by God.
All jinn occupy a constant place in the 
folklore of Islam and share several common 
characteristics. Some myths tell of impious 
humans that have transformed into jinn on 
their deaths, although whether this de-
scribes the creation of Infernal ghosts or 
transformation into Magic spirits or some 
kind of Faerie apotheosis is difficult to de-
termine. The true nature of bazarkh, the 
soul’s experiences immediately after death, 
has not been elucidated by the few Me-
rinita and Criamon scholars interested in 
pursuing this state. See the “Terminology 
of Jinn” sidebar for further details.
All jinn are said to be composed of 
“smokeless fire” — the exact nature of this 
varies depending on the chosen Realm 
alignment of the particular jinni: Faerie 
jinn are composed of Glamour, Infernal 
jinn have bodies of rarefied power and 
Magic jinn are composed of pure magic. 
This magical body is usually aligned to the 
Form of Vim, rather than being flame as-
sociated with the Form of Ignem, although 
some jinn, particularly Magic jinn, are 
strongly aligned to the elemental Forms. 
Most jinn can assume a physical form 
composed of elemental matter or solid en-
ergy using one of their powers. Many have 
the ability to change their shape into ele-
mental manifestations, animals, humanoid 
forms, or the shape of particular humans. 
Jinn divide themselves into several 
main tribes that roughly correlate with 
their Realm alignment. Thus the Jann are 
lesser Faerie jinn that follow the ways of 
Islam and pass for human merchants, no-
Chapter Four
The Jinn
Other Middle Eastern Spirits: Non-Jinn
Common Muslim folk sometimes 
mistakenly refer to ghosts and other su-
pernatural creatures from Arab folklore as 
jinn. Dhilan, ghaddars, hatifs, naddahas, 
nisnases, shiqq, and udars are not jinn in 
the sense given here, nor are the Persian 
divs, yazatas, and peris. However, Faerie 
jinn may mimic or assume roles similar 
to these creatures in order to entrap hu-
mans in their stories. These creatures 
have different origins than jinn: ghosts 
may have once been humans; some have 
been created by magical mishaps or the 
workings of ancient wizards; others are 
aligned to the Divine or Infernal Realms. 
Despite their name, the Faerie creatures 
referred to as Soqotran jinniyah and as-
sociated with the Myrrh trees of that is-
land are not true jinn and are similarly 
unaffected by Sihr. 
Arab folklore also blames many su-
pernatural events and occurrences, in-
cluding ghostly haunting, on the jinn. 
Thus the term “jinni” is also mistakenly 
used to describe any magical spirit, ef-
fect or creature. The lesser Airy Spirits, 
including the entities understood by 
Hermetic theory as Spell Spirits, are 
similarly explained using this lesser term, 
though they lack the cultural identity of 
true jinn. The Named Spirits of Her-
metic Theurgy, such as the Astra Planeta 
daimons so well known to Arab wizards, 
are also not considered jinn, and are re-
ferred to instead as al-Nujum, “the Stars.” 
To the ignorant mundane, anything 
supernatural is jinn, but to a sahir, a 
jinni is a specific creature subject to the 
Art of Sihr and its legacy of command 
passed down from the wisdom of Sulei-
man. This makes dealing with unknown 
supernatural entities potentially difficult 
and dangerous for a sahir, and so most 
prefer to rely on knowledge passed down 
by their forebears and are very cautious 
when dealing with encountered spirits 
they have not summoned directly.
Sahirs using Sihr or their Solomon-
ic Magic have no exceptional power 
over these other spiritual creatures but 
some may be able to use different magi-
cal abilities such as the Goetic Arts of 
Summoning and Commanding to affect 
these spirits.

mads, or shepherds, interacting with hu-
mans in stories involving hospitality and 
morality. The Shaitan are a collection of 
both dark Faerie and Infernal spirits, some 
of who have become corrupted into true 
terrestrial demons. The Ghul tribe consists 
of dark Faerie sexual predators and canni-
balistic Infernal savages that haunt cem-
eteries and graveyards looking for carrion 
or lone travelers. The powerful Marid tribe 
are a loose alliance of ancient Magic ele-
mental spirits of water, wind, and weather 
found predominantly in Arabia.
Terminology  
of Jinn
The exact nature of jinn is difficult 
to define, as the term is used collectively 
to refer to a myriad of spirits variously 
aligned to the Faerie, Infernal and Magic 
Realms. There are no Divine jinn, only Is-
lamic angels. 
Other terms used within the various 
folk tales refer to rank or power within 
various tribes of jinn. The names ‘afrit and 
marid usually refer to the stronger types 
of Faerie jinn, although their relationship 
to humanity can be either benevolent or 
antagonistic depending on their defin-
ing role. Confusingly, the terms Ifrit and 
Marid also refer to two of more power-
ful of the reportedly 112 jinni tribes. The 
term “shaitan” typically refers to dark Fa-
erie jinn but is also used to refer to Infernal 
jinn in general, the specific tribe of jinn 
known as Shaitan, and in many cases to 
Iblis himself.
Jinn Defined 
Mechanically 
The sahir summoning art of Sihr is 
defined in its scope by its limitation of 
summoning only jinn (see Chapter 3: The 
Order of Suleiman). In this book, the term 
jinni refers specifically to the collective 
group of supernatural spirits (in Latin, ge-
nii) that inhabit the Islamic lands and are 
integral to wider Arab culture. 
This definition includes jinn aligned 
to the Faerie Realm, as well as those ge-
nii loci found in Muslim lands aligned to 
the Magic realm. It also addresses a range 
of Infernal spirits: true demons of Islamic 
lands and wider Arab folklore, such as Iblis 
and his descendents; the ghul; and local 
Middle Eastern examples of demons, such 
as mazzikim and shedim. 
Together they form a collective of en-
tities of varied Realm alignment character-
ized by the following:
• They share a common special Free 
Virtue: Jinni that denotes their 
unique status.
• They have True Names that can 
be learned, even those jinn of low 
Might Score.
• They are supernatural spirits native 
to the lands of the Dar al-Islam: the 
Levant, Iberia, the Maghreb, Egypt, 
Arabia, Iraq, Mesopotamia, Persia, and 
Transoxiana.
• They have encountered Islam and 
chosen to accept (Faerie), reject (dark 
Faerie), ignore (Magic), or oppose (In-
fernal) the teachings of the Prophet.
• They almost universally speak and un-
derstand Arabic (classical) as an Abil-
ity, Pretense, or via magic — rare an-
cient jinn may speak Aramaic, Hebrew 
or lost Semitic languages.
• They have the Ability (or Pretense, if 
Faerie jinn) Theology: Islam (jinn) as 
part of their exposure to and incorpo-
ration into Arab culture. 
• They have some supernatural power 
that allows them to remain hidden 
when desired — either invisibility, im-
materiality, illusory form, or the ability 
to shapechange into animal guise.
Ultimately, the storyguide is the final 
arbiter on what is a jinni and what is not a 
jinni. Specific Faerie or Infernal jinni may 
not rigidly conform to the guidelines pre-
sented here if it suits their concept or role 
to be an exception — this may include 
select Hermetic and Heroic Virtues and 
Flaws at the discretion of the storyguide. 
Each jinni is an individual with his own 
unique place in the story. Be creative.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Ghosts, demons that are not specifi-
cally Infernal jinn, and the European spirits 
of the Faerie and Magic Realm familiar to 
Hermetic magi are definitely not jinn. Crea-
tures of Virtue and other physical creatures 
with a Might score are also not jinn.
Common Jinn Traits
Most jinn who interact regularly with 
humans possess the Faerie Speech Minor 
Virtue or an equivalent power such as the 
Minor Heroic Virtue Gift of Tongues in-
stead, giving them the ability to converse 
in all spoken languages. Some of the rare-
ly-encountered pre-Islamic jinn may claim 
to speak only Aramaic, or some other an-
cient Semitic language.
Jinn frequently have Second Sight and 
a Greater Malediction stating that, when it 
enters a bargain, it is bound to the agreed 
terms unless its partner reneges first. The 
supernatural nature of jinn is usually appar-
ent to regular humans and some animals, 
such as cats, dogs and horses, although 
this is reflected in different Flaws for jinn 
of different Realms as noted later. Many 
humanoid jinn possess one or more of the 
Skinchanger Minor Virtue and the Ways 
of the Land (Desert or, less commonly, 
Mountains or Plains) and the Greater Im-
munity: Fire Major Virtues. 
As spiritual beings, jinn must possess 
the Donning the Corporeal Veil Power 
(for Magic jinn) or a similar power, such 
as Coagulation (for Infernal jinn) or an 
equivalent (for Faerie jinn), in order to cre-
ate a physical body that can interact with 
material beings. Some minor jinn, such 
as the Faerie jann and the Infernal ghul, 
are spirits locked into a physical form, but 
they can shapechange into at least one 
other form or become insubstantial or in-
visible for short periods of time.
Jinn are generally considered extreme-
ly long-lived (equivalent to the effects of 
the Faerie Blood Minor Virtue) but are 
not always immortal, and many lesser jinn 
have the Age Quickly Major Flaw rather 
than being truly immortal spirits.
Not all jinn have Conﬁdence, but 
many Faerie jinn possess the Reputation 
as Confidence Virtue, which grants Con-
fidence to be used for specific actions re-
lated to their roles, similar to the Ferocity 
Virtue of animals. Some Infernal jinn have 
lost the ability to act contrary to the dic-
tates of their passions, transforming into 
true terrestrial demons, and thus lack a 
Confidence score.
Jinn and Free Will
Although jinn appear to possess free 
will, Islamic scholars believe this may 
not be true. The Ghul and Shaitan tribes 
have already made a choice to side with 
evil and this decision is reflected in their 
predominantly dark Faerie nature. Those 
individual Infernal jinn who have become 
true demons have sacrificed their free will 
on becoming irrevocably aligned with Ib-
lis and the Infernal. Faerie jinn may act as 
if they have freedom but, in truth, their 
choices are restrained by the roles and sto-
ries they inhabit.
All jinn claim a common origin in Jin-
nistan. Some sahirs and scholars speculate 
that this means jinn began as creatures of 
the Magic Realm born with free will, and 
Jinni Names
Jinni names, while similar to those 
of the humans of the Mythic Middle 
East, have their own peculiarities. 
Generally, such names fall into sev-
eral broad categories and follow con-
ventions similar to other Arab names 
including the use of nasab, kunya and 
nisbas. Only the more powerful ranks 
of jinn such as the ‘afrit and marid have 
multiple names, often using an honor-
ific name to describe their greatness 
(laqab) (see the Appendix for further 
details on names).
The first group of names includes 
those jinn named after common animals 
of which they can assume the shape, 
particularly in the case of Faerie jinn. 
Such names include: 
Af’aa (“Snake”), Arnab (“Hare”), 
Baghl (“Mule”), Fa’r (“Mouse”), Feel 
(“Elephant”), Hemaar (“Donkey”), He-
saan (“Horse”), Jamal (“Camel”), Kalb 
(“Dog”), Maa’ez (“Goat”), Nasr (“Vul-
ture”), Qett (“Cat”), and so forth. Many 
Magic jinn are named after the natural 
feature they are associated with as their 
locus: Amirat al-Jabal (“lady emir of the 
mountain”), Ighraq al-Siq (“torrent of 
the gorge”). Others have titular names 
or nicknames (nisba): ‘Abd al-Qinnina 
(“slave of the bottle”), Bali’ al-Ard (“swal-
lower of the ground”), al-Damawi (“the 
bloody”), al-Ghazzalin (“the weaver”), 
al-Khalil (“the Empty One”), al-Malik 
(“the king”), al-Qatil (“the slayer”). 
Finally, many Faerie jinn have names 
that seem almost human but have an un-
real or dissonant quality to them, for ex-
ample: Anees al-Galees, Jerjees, Kabikaj, 
Kharrat, Khyron, Qumqam, Singam, 
Sakr, Zamzam, Zarmabaha. Troupes 
are encouraged to generate these latter 
names by changing some of the letters 
of Arabic, Aramaic, Turkish or Persian 
names at random.
Story Seed:  
The List of Suleiman
King Suleiman was granted domin-
ion over all jinn by God and many sahirs 
believe that the Art of Sihr is directly 
descended from his powers. Legends 
speak of a codex written by the prophet 
containing the True Names of all jinn, 
a priceless treasure for any summoner. 
The list can reputedly update and edit 
itself magically as jinn are born and die.
Some sahirs claim to have found 
fragments of Suleiman’s list amidst 
the pages of other books dealing with 
(Realm) Lore — pages on which archaic 
names sometimes disappear or emerge 
between readings. Whether these pages 
are truly fragments of the greater list or 
Faerie books created from the legend is 
unclear — not all the names appear to 
be genuine True Names. Both Hermetic 
magi and sahirs may seek to recover such 
fragments in the hope of reconstructing 
either the whole text or discovering the 
means of capturing the True Names of 
new jinn.

Jumayl, A Jinni Guide
This lesser jinni has been created as 
an example starting magus-level char-
acter using the full rules from Realms of 
Power: Faerie. The selection of skills and 
particular powers are designed to be 
useful for a party traveling through the 
Mythic Middle East. His need for vitality 
and human interaction to recover Might 
points provide a strong hook to involve 
him in adventures and active stories, 
making him a good choice to accompa-
ny magi as a guide throughout the area 
covered by this book. 
Jumayl may be found in any major 
city in the region or even the ports of 
the Levant, but he favors the bustling 
markets around the fortress of al-Mush-
aqqar in Bahrayn (see Chapter 6: Mythic 
Arabia), where well-paid work and cheap 
alcohol can be easily found.

Powers:
Cuirass of the Zephyr, 1 point, Init +3, 
Auram; as Circling Winds of Protection 
with Duration of Recitation / Qira’a 
(as long as Jumayl keeps reciting 
verses of the Qur’an — equivalent to 
Concentration).
Blinding Light of the Pious, 1 point, Init +3, 
Ignem; as Flash of the Scarlet Flames.
Tay al-Ard (Travel), 4 points, Init +1, Cor-
pus; this power instantly transports 
Jumayl and 2 individuals he holds 
hands with from one location to an-
other that he has visited before or has 
an Arcane Connection to, regardless 
of distance. As Leap of Homecom-
ing, with R: Touch, T: Group, 45 
spell levels, 1 Intricacy point spent 
on reduced cost.
Equipment: a fine damascene steel long 
sword, leather scale caravan guard 
armor, flashy jewelry
Vis: 3 pawns of Vim vis, camel’s tooth
Appearance: Jumayl (“little camel”) is a 
comely, lithe man of uncertain ori-
ental appearance, alabaster skin and 
white hair. One eye is iridescent 
green, the other ocean blue. He fa-
vors swirling robes dyed a deep blue 
color over light leather armor, high-
lighted by gold jewelry. 
This jinni, one of the jann, is a mer-
cenary guide, forced to wander from 
caravanserai to caravanserai along the 
trade routes of the Levant, Arabia, Per-
sia, Transoxiana, and beyond for a crime 
his brother committed. An excellent 
swordsman and skilled outdoorsman, 
he is well known among the Muslim 
merchants and even Levantine Redcaps 
for his easy-going nature and bravado 
in defending caravans from raiders and 
brigands. Like most Faerie jinn, he can 
change into an animal form — in his 
case, a white wild Bactrian camel using 
his Skinchanger Virtue.
Although immune to Fatigue like 
other faeries, Jumayl is unusually sus-
ceptible to the effects of mundane alco-
hol — a weakness that helps him to play 
his role within stories along the caravan 
routes. Unlike most faeries, due to his 
Might Recovery Requires Vitality Flaw, 
his Might points, once spent, can only 
recover if he gets a full night’s rest and 
eats a meal in the company of fellow 
travelers. This must be done within a 
human community, eating travel rations 
or caravanserai meals, drinking bever-
ages fermented by humans and listen-
ing to humans sing or tell tales about 
their travels. For every eight hours the 
character rests, he recovers a number 
of Might Points equal to the prevailing 
Aura as modified by the Realm Interac-
tion Table, or 1, whichever is greater. He 
does not actually need to eat or drink 
however. Jumayl knows enough about 
wizards to avoid leaving Arcane Con-
nections carelessly and keeps his True 
Name a close secret. 
His powers have been created as 
Greater Powers but could readily be re-
duced to Lesser Powers to downgrade 
him to a standard companion if his Os-
tentatious Major Virtue, 2 Increased Faer-
ie Might Minor Virtues and Highly Cog-
nizant Minor Virtues were also dropped. 
In this case, his Might Recovery Requires 
Vitality Major Flaw should be replaced 
with three Minor Flaws. Alternatively, if 
used as an NPC, his Virtues and Flaws 
do not need to balance and further pow-
ers with illusions or summoning animals 
could be added.

The Cradle & The Crescent
changed their Realm alignment to either 
Faerie or the Infernal only after interact-
ing with humanity and coming into con-
tact with Islam, losing their free will in 
the process.
The fact of the matter is unclear — 
jinn may only appear to change Realms. 
For example, a Magic jinni of a local 
geographic feature may be replaced by a 
Faerie jinni created through stories of its 
interactions with nearby Muslims. Alter-
natively an Infernal jinni, attracted by the 
potential for sin created by the presence 
of pagan Magic spirit, may destroy the 
original genius loci and take its place. To 
common folk and even magi, the jinni may 
appear to have changed Realms as the new 
spirit assumes the name, appearance, and 
role of the original entity.
Pious and Impious Jinn
Those jinn who profess to have sub-
mitted to or rejected Islam are aligned 
to the Faerie Realm. Often referred to 
as pious and impious jinn, their religious 
behavior is a sham required by their roles 
in that they appear to uphold or illustrate 
Islam’s tenets as an example or challenge 
to humans. This type of jinni is the one 
most likely to be involved with mundanes 
and they are frequently encountered in the 
Mythic Middle East.
These creatures often live in groups 
like humans and mimic the behavior and 
culture of their mundane neighbors, of-
ten appearing as merchants, shepherds 
and nomads, although city-dwelling jinn 
are frequently encountered in the farther 
reaches of the Mythic Middle East. Such 
jinn generally live in close proximity to 
humans but in places humans find inhos-
pitable: deserts, ruins, wastelands, and 
abandoned houses, or in wells, cisterns, 
latrines, and other taboo places. Together 
they comprise a group of Faeries involved 
in meddling with humans in a variety of 
boundary stories, whether physically or 
philosophically, but most commonly rep-
resenting tales concerned with social dis-
tinctions or adulthood.
Most of these Faerie-aligned jinn share 
the following Virtues and Flaws in addition 
to those noted earlier for all jinn: Eidolon, 
Bali’ al-Ard, a Bedouin racehorse
Beloved by his master, a young Bed-
ouin sahir named Salih al-Kamil, this 
jinni takes the form of an exceptional 
Arabian stallion renowned for his racing 
ability. His magical travel powers and 
lack of fatigue allow him to cheat during 
the dust and confusion of longer desert 
races. This gives his master great status 
and pride, feeding his need for Vitality, 
but is also the source of continual ha-
rassment from horse breeders wishing to 
mate their mares in the hope of produc-
ing talented offspring. As they are un-
aware of the Faerie nature of the horse, 
such suitors do not realize that time out 
at stud deprives his master of his magi-
cal aid and that such unions will always 
be unsuccessful in producing foals.
Bali’ al-Ard

‘ al-Ard from one location to another 
within seven leagues that he can see 
or has an Arcane Connection to. As 
Seven League Stride but as a non-Her-
metic effect allows the rider to ac-
company him to fulfill his racehorse

and 2 Intricacy points spent on re-
duced Might cost.
Immateriality, 3 points, Init +2, Imaginem;

horseshoe 
Appearance: Bali’ al-Ard (Arabic, “The 
Swallower of the Ground”), ap-
pears as a magnificent example of 
an Arabian stallion, a breed famed 
throughout the Mythic Middle East 
and even in far-off Europe. 
This jinni can only assume animal 
form although he is able to become im-
material. He is an example of a potential 
khadim (servant spirit) of a beginning 
unGifted sahir with only limited scores 
in the Solomonic Arts. See Chapter 3: 
The Order of Suleiman for more details 
of khadim and sahir.
Bali is not balanced for use as a start-
ing player character and is based on 
an Arabian racing horse — essentially 
a modified courser. Like all horses he 
gains a +3 to running rolls.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Bottles of Suleiman, Slaves of the King
There we saw a man casting his net to 
catch fish, and presently he pulled them 
up and behold, in them was a cucurbite 
of copper, stopped with lead and sealed 
with the signet of Solomon, son of Da-
vid, on whom be peace! He brought the 
vessel to land and broke it open, when 
there came forth a smoke, which rose a 
twisting blue to the zenith, and we heard 
a horrible voice, saying, ‘I repent! I re-
pent! Pardon, O Prophet of Allah! I will 
never return to that which I did afore-
time.’ Then the smoke became a terrible 
Giant frightful of form, whose head was 
level with the mountaintops, and he van-
ished from our sight...
— Tale of the “The City of Brass,” 
             The Thousand and One Nights
Folk tales abound in Eastern folk-
lore of poor fisherman who cast their 
nets into the ocean, calling upon God’s 
aid only to pull in strange and ancient 
bottles. Termed “cucurbites” and known 
to the peasant folk as Suleimanic Bottles, 
these vessels are gourd-shaped copper 
flasks sealed with a lead plug embossed 
with the Seal of Suleiman. When the 
stopper is removed, a jinni issues forth, 
either thankful or wrathful toward its 
rescuer, but always a potential source of 
wealth or woe. In some tales the prison 
is in the form of a seal ring, or, most fa-
mously, a humble battered lamp. The 
origin of these mystical containers is 
unclear — some may indeed represent 
pre-Islamic jinn bound by Suleiman in 
ancient days, while other examples may 
represent echoes of the legends of spirits 
bound by his magical descendants and 
contemporary sorcerers.
So popular has this motif become in 
Arab folklore that a particular type of Fa-
erie jinn, the Bottles of Suleiman, have 
become associated with this story, tak-
ing the form of the vessels themselves. 
Typically involved in stories about the 
Bringing of Riches and Humility (Realms 
of Power: Faerie, page 79), these liminal en-
tities can be found anywhere along the 
shorelines of Islamic lands, usually near 
the villages of poor fishermen.

leasing” the apparently captive ‘afrit 
from its prison, the rescuer can bar-
gain for a set three wishes or a length

Ritual Power (Grant: Wealthy), 5 In-
tricacy points spent on cost.
Vis: 6 pawns of Imaginem, concentrated 
in its cucurbite prop
Appearance: These Faeries initially appear 
as their cucurbite, a solid gourd-shaped 
flask of copper, using their Eidolon and 
Loosely Material powers. They shift 
into their smoky column form only 
when the Seal of Suleiman stoppering 
their apparent prison is disturbed. This 
latter form consists of a giant human 
torso of unnatural color, often red, but 
sometimes blue or green, surmounted 
by a monstrous face with horns or jag-
ged teeth. To the inexperienced ob-
server, this fearsome manifestation ap-
pears to be the actual faerie, although 
in reality the jinni remains an insub-
stantial spirit beneath the illusion.
Bottles of Suleiman is not suitable as 
player characters due to their unbalanced 
power and their limited independent po-
tential in stories. Only an exceptionally 
experienced sahira would be able to bind 
this powerful version as a spirit compan-
ion using the khadim bond, although 
lesser examples of this type of jinn may 
be attractive to younger sahira. This jinni 
is primarily inspired by the stories “The 
Fisherman and the Jinni” and “The City 
of Brass.”

The Cradle & The Crescent
Loosely Material, Intangible Flesh, and 
Traditional Ward (Bismillah Invocation), 
or rarely, Sovereign Ward (Bismillah Invo-
cation). These jinn commonly have pow-
ers associated with illusions, flight, shape 
changing (into animals, whirlwinds or 
other humans), and travel, rather than the 
elemental-themed powers of their Magic 
cousins. Many Faerie jinn suffer from the 
Minor Flaws Dutybound (Bedouin hos-
pitality), Vulnerable to Brass, Vulnerable 
Magic (mua’addhin’s call) and/or Vulner-
able to Folk Tradition. Unlike most other 
faeries, Faerie jinn possess True Names 
as noted earlier, even if they have a low 
Might Score.
The minor Faerie jinn known as jann 
are highly dependent on human interac-
tion and differ from their cousins in that 
they must have a physical form, although 
every janni can transform into at least one 
other shape, usually an animal. Such less-
er Faerie jinn have the following Virtues 
and Flaws: Humanoid Form, Pass as Hu-
man, Dutybound (Bedouin hospitality), 
Restricted Might Recovery, Traditional 
Ward: Bismillah Invocation.
Examples of Faerie jinn with details 
of some of the Virtues, Flaws and powers 
mentioned earlier include the Bottles of 
Suleiman, Faerie ghulas, Hesaan the race-
horse, and the janni Mythic Companion-
level character, Jumayl, detailed nearby. 
Faerie jinni counterparts to many Eu-
ropean faeries exist within the Mythic 
Middle East and can be adapted for use in 
a saga set in the Mythic Middle East, see 
the Faerie Bestiary of Realms of Power: Faer-
ies, pages 70–83, for further details.
Pre-Islamic Jinn
Long ago during al-Jahiliyya, the 
pre-Islamic times of the past, Faerie jinn 
claiming Jewish and Christian beliefs 
were common. Even in the days before 
the Great Deluge, the jinn are purported 
to have followed the original monotheis-
tic religion of Adam. Such jinn would be 
also considered Faerie rather than Magic 
in alignment, but are seemingly rare in the 
thirteenth century.
Many jinn are said to have been im-
prisoned in ancient times by the Sulei-
man. These jinn either declare their faith 
in the older forms of religion when en-
countered or else claim to have converted 
to Islam somehow during their captivity. 
Such ancient Faerie jinn can be difficult 
to distinguish from the elemental jinn 
noted later, even for experienced sahirs, 
and play roles in stories about discover-
ies of the past and the fleeting nature of 
mortal achievements. 
Pagan Jinn
Jinn that show little interest in the 
affairs of mankind or the message of the 
Prophet are typically aligned with the 
Magic Realm. Referred to as pagan or hea-
then (kaffir, “unbeliever”) jinn, these ele-
mental spirits are tied to specific landscape 
features in the wilderness that lies between 
the major settlements of Arab civilization 
across Persia, the Holy land, North Af-
rica, and southern Iberia. This natural fea-
ture may be an oasis pool, a mountain or 
a stretch of desert. These spirits are true 
genii loci, only able to leave their feature 
through transferring their locus to an indi-
vidual or object through a form of magical 
bargain, and may reflect the most ancient 
and original manifestation of jinn — spir-
its defined by their geographic identity 
rather than their reflection of and interac-
tion with Islamic culture.
Some of these pagan jinn claim to 
represent pre-Islamic divinities worshiped 
by the Arabs in ancient times or ancient 
powers of long lost races and cultures, 
but they are not dependent on human 
vitality like their Faerie counterparts. As 
Islam spread, other initially non-Arab 
Magic spirits were forced to adapt, ac-
cepting additional Inferiorities in return 
for retaining their places of power or else 
evolving into Faerie or Infernal versions 
of their former manifestations like the 
Forest Spirits of ancient Germany (see 
Chapter 3: The Forest of Guardians of the 
Forest for further ideas).
As primal Magic creatures, many have 
strong elemental ties. They are aligned 
with one of the classical elemental Forms 
of Auram, Aquam, Ignem and Terram and 
can be affected by the appropriate El-

The Cradle & The Crescent
emental Summoning Art, although they 
have true intelligence and are not con-
sidered simple elementals. Other jinn 
embody the living Herbam aspects of 
nature. Such Magical jinn, being Magical 
Spirits, need not eat or drink and do not 
age unless they suffer from the optional 
Age Quickly Flaw.
These elemental creatures are the type 
of jinn most commonly summoned by 
both non-Hermetic and Hermetic sahirs 
and are generally the most easy to identify 
as jinn using either Magic Lore or an ap-
propriate Area Lore (see Chapter 3: The 
Order of Suleiman). Each has a mandatory 
Ways of the (Land) Virtue and Magical Air 
Flaw. These jinn may possesses some or 
all of the following Powers: Donning the 
Corporeal Veil (at least once for humanoid 
form, although additional animal forms are 
common), Guide, Manifestation and Pres-
ence. Crafter of (Form) and/or Ruler of 
(Form) are common among greater genii 
loci but optional for lesser jinn. The most 
powerful examples of these pagan jinn are 
true Daimons (see Realms of Power: Magic, 
page 110). The jinni Wahhab is an ex-
ample of a Pagan jinn (see Houses of Hermes: 
Societates, page 135). 
Unlike their Faerie and Infernal cous-
ins, Magic jinn are not automatically 
susceptible to the Bismillah Invocation, 
although many of the less powerful en-
tities possess a Minor Flaw mechanically 
equivalent to the Traditional Ward (Bis-
millah Invocation) of their Faerie cousins. 
Some of the more powerful entities with 
greater familiarity with the teachings of 
Islam, as represented by a Theology: Is-
lam score of 3 or more, may even feign 
submissiveness to catch an unsuspecting 
sahir off-guard.
The great Daimon of the Empty Quar-
ter, Al-Khalil, mentioned in Chapter 6: 
Mythic Arabia, the jinni at the base of the 
Whirlpool of Uballa (Chapter 7: Mythic 
Mesopotamia) or the feared ruler of the 
Taklimakan (Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) 
would all be appropriate to design as pow-
erful Magic jinn.
Creating Magic Jinn by Example: 
Baghl and Ighraq al-Siq
Baghl, see insert earlier, has been 
created by using the lesser flame jinni 
Wahhab from Houses of Hermes: Societates, 
page 135, as a starting point, changing 
his Form alignment to Terram but retain-
ing his resistance to flames. He is an ex-
ample of a lesser earth jinni that might 
be pressed into service by a more mature 
sahir as a khadim, and is not designed as a 
starting character. Alternatively, he could 
be a potential patron for a Spirit Votary 
if he could be coaxed out of his cave, 
but would need to add the Grant: Spiri-
tual Pact Ritual Power, which may require 
trading additional Inferiorities (see Realms 
of Power: Magic, pages 88–89, for details 
of Spirit Votaries). As a spirit of a place, 
the physical location haunted by this 
jinni acts as an Arcane Connection that 
provides a +1 bonus to the Penetration 
Multiplier; more potent Arcane Connec-
tions can only be obtained from the jinni 
if he takes corporeal form.
Unusually for a jinni of his power, 
Baghl has a reasonable knowledge of Islam 
and may pretend to be susceptible to the 
folk traditions that affect Faerie jinn, al-
though except for the muezzin’s call, such 
rituals have no real effect over him.
Ighraq al-Siq, from Chapter 7: Myth-
ic Mesopotamia, is an example of a very 
powerful Magic jinni with a strong el-
Variants on the Genie of the Lamp Motif
The creature ‘Abd al-Qininna re-
flects a reasonably powerful version of 
this motif — an ‘afrit able to drastically 
change the fortunes of the poor man 
who releases it. In contrast, the simplest 
and least powerful of this class may pos-
sess only the Eidolon power, have much 
diminished characteristics and merely 
dissipate upon release with a great show 
of imagery and an exclamation in praise 
of Allah and Suleiman. These lesser jinn 
feed off the vitality shed by the simple 
wonder of the common fisherman before 
dissolving their cucurbite or projecting 
an illusion of it washing back out to sea 
in the confusion caused.
Although bottles are the common-
est form for the cucurbite prop, similar 
Faerie jinni prisons have been described 
that manifest as brass rings, bowls, or 
most famously as a battered lamp. The 
creature portrayed in the Aladdin story 
would be more powerful than the one 
described here, perhaps with a Might 
of 50 or more and extra magical pow-
ers. An intermediate example with a Fa-
erie Might of only 20 would simulate the 
“Slave of the Ring” in the Tale of Aladdin 
or one of the lesser jinni initially called 
upon by Suleiman to fetch the throne of 
Balqis, Queen of Sheba.
Three Wishes?
Many captive Faerie jinn are com-
pelled by their story to bargain or create 
a contract with their rescuer. Typically, 
such jinn offer three wishes, within their 
power, using their Binding Oath Ritual 
Power. The price of the compact is usu-
ally the promise of release from further 
imprisonment once service has been 
rendered. Breaking the contract inflicts a 
Major Flaw. Depending on how carefully 
the party promising release has couched 
the terms of the contract, this Flaw may 
either allow the ‘afrit to angrily depart, 
cursing its arrogant rescuer with a poor 
reputation (Faerie Antipathy, Major) or 
to remain and torment the foolish knave 
until driven off (Plagued by Supernatu-
ral Entity).
Those experienced in the bargains of 
jinn, possessing a Faerie Lore score of 6 
or greater or one of the applicable sum-
moning Arts or Accelerated Abilities at 
11 or more, know to include the appro-
priate caveats to prevent the latter occur-
rence. These individuals are also aware 
of the correct formulae to command 
the released Faerie back into its prison, 
successfully ending the story safely. Of 
course, the knowledge of what to use the 
third and final wish for does not protect 
against the temptation of greed.

The Cradle & The Crescent
emental affinity designed as an Autumn 
starting character using the rules from 
Realms of Power: Magic, but Magic jinn 
do not necessarily have to be balanced 
to be used in play. He could potentially 
be summoned and perhaps even con-
trolled by an experienced sahir or Her-
metic magus. As these spirits are bound 
to a landscape feature or compelled to a 
magical bargain, they are best designed 
as non-player characters or as challenges 
for the troupe, rather than companions in 
a conventional saga. This character can 
be used as a template for similar elemen-
tal jinn using the suggestions earlier and 
the rules for genii loci Magic Spirits as 
detailed in Realms of Power: Magic (pages 
106–107) and ideas from the section on 
elementals (pages 132–139). Note that his 
base Magic Might for character creation 
using the rules in Realms of Power: Magic is 
35, although this as been increased to 40 
using repeated purchase of the Improved 
Might Virtue. 
He differs in powers from many Fa-
erie jinn in that his magic is primarily el-
emental rather than illusory and is greatly 
focused by the physical constraints of his 
narrow surroundings. Like many other pa-
gan jinn he is supernaturally tethered to 
his physical locale and suffers a significant 
drop in power if separated from it — in 
his case, he is tied to the body of the Zab 
River and is reluctant even to step onto 
its banks.
Alternatively this creature can be used 
as the inspiration for a similar Faerie crea-
ture or an Infernal jinn related to the Or-
der of Aerial Powers. A medium powered 
creature would have a Might of 20–25, 
being roughly comparable in power to a 
starting Hermetic magus, and could eas-
ily be aligned to Auram or Terram instead 
with some minor modification. 
Unlike most Magical spirits of similar 
magnitude, Ighraq al-Siq does not possess 
the Daimon Special Virtue, although he 
does possess a True Name like all jinn. If 
granted the Daimon Virtue, he can only 
be bargained with using Hermetic Theur-
gy and cannot be controlled or coerced 
using simpler magic (see Realms of Power: 
Magic, page 102).

Flesh to Stone, 2 points, Init –4, Terram; 
Baghl can change any human he 
touches into stone until sunrise or 
until the morning call to prayer 
(Base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; 3 
Mastery points spent on reducing 
Might cost).
Ruler of Earth, 1–3 points, Init 0, Terram; 
Duplicates any non-Ritual Perdo 
Terram or Rego Terram spell less 
than or equal to 15th level at a cost 
of 1 Might point per magnitude of 
the effect.
Incorporeal, 0 points, Init Constant, Men-
tem: Baghl is naturally both invisible 
and intangible, and cannot be influ-
enced by the physical world. Magic 
can only directly target him if the 
caster can sense his existence. In this 
form he has no physical statistics or 
combat scores. Without taking a cor-
poreal form, Baghl’s physical charac-
teristics are only used when dealing 
with other incorporeal creatures.
Donning the Corporeal Veil, 2 points, Init +1, 
Corpus: Baghl can form the physical 
body described under Appearance to 
house his spiritual form; when doing 
so he acquires the physical charac-
teristics, size, combat statistics, and 
Wound levels listed earlier. His arms 
and armor are also created with this 
power. He cannot become fatigued. 
This body lasts until he decides he 
no longer needs it. Killing the body 
does not kill Baghl. 
Presence, 0 points, constant, Mentem: 
Baghl is aware of everything that 
goes on within his haunt. This power 
needs to Penetrate to perceive beings 
with a Magic Resistance. 
Vis: 1 pawn of Terram vis can be col-
lected every year from his haunt, in 
the form of a quartz-encrusted sta-
lactite at the back of his cave. If slain 
in physical form, his body yields 3 
pawns of Terram vis.
Appearance: Baghl is the jinni of a dark 
cave found in the Elbruz mountains 
that was once used as a quarry until 
he drove off the miners. He may be 
appeased mainly by being left alone 
to enjoy his beautiful cave forma-
tions, although he sometimes agrees 
to converse with theological schol-
ars. He appears as an obese man with 
a mule’s head, pupilless eyes of jet-
black stone, and quartz-veined limbs 
that heft an oversized maul. In physi-
cal form he can assume the shape of 
a large black mule.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Buran of Yenghissar
This wild desert storm spirit, or 
buran, once plagued the small village of 
Yenghissar along the route to Khashgar, 
bringing devastation to the crops and 
herd animals every seven years. It is now 
bound by an Infernally-aligned sahir us-
ing the Goetic Art of Binding (see Realms 
of Power: The Infernal, page 117). A speech-
less, destructive force of fury incarnate, 
it rages to be released and constantly 
strives to create elemental havoc around 
the thoughtless sahir who has trapped it 
within his ancestral sword.
The Buran
Infernal Might: 25 (Auram)
Order: Aerial Powers (Buran)
Characteristics: Int –5, Per 0, Pre +3, 
Com -2, Str na, Sta na, Dex +3, 
Qik +6
Size: +4
Confidence Score: 1 (3)
Virtues and Flaws: Jinni; Berserk, 
Strong-Willed, Wilderness Sense; 
Fury (Major) (when summoned), 
Greater Malediction (bound by bar-
gains), Mute
Personality Traits: Untameable +5
Reputations: Scourge of Yenghissar 2 
(local)
Hierarchy: 3 (storm demons) 
Combat: Not applicable, the buran is an 
insubstantial spirit
Soak: Not applicable, the buran is an in-
substantial spirit
Wound Penalties: Not applicable, the 
buran is an insubstantial spirit
Abilities: Arabic 5 (understanding)*, Folk 
Ken 3 (travelers), Theology: Islam 3 
(jinn), Survival 5 (desert), Taklam-
akan Lore 5 (legends), Wilderness 
Sense 2 (weather)
* 	 Represents level of understanding as 
the spirit is Mute.
Powers:
Delusion of the Desert, 1 or 5 points, Init +3, 
Imaginem: This evil spirit can create 
illusions of a lost traveler’s compan-
ions or a welcoming oasis, only to 
launch itself in fury at an unsuspect-
ing victim. Alternatively it can cre-
ate images of itself as a humanoid 
sandstorm with glowing fiery eyes 
in order to terrify its victims prior to 
their deaths. A minor illusion which 
affects an Individual amount of mate-
rial (such as the demon itself) costs 
one point; a larger illusion which 
fills a room costs five points. These 
visions always have a flaw, however 
(they smell wrong, can only be seen 
by one target, etc.).
Elemental Control of Wind ; variable points; 
Init +1; Auram: The buran has con-
trol over the winds of nature, which it 
uses to wreak destruction on the des-
ert fringes. It may create any Creo, 
Muto, or Rego effect appropriate to 
Auram, at a cost of 1 Might Point 
per magnitude of effect. The demon 
cannot create any effect with a level 
greater than its Infernal Might, nor 
duplicate Ritual effects.
Recalcitrance, 0 points, Init constant, Vim: 
Any attempt to control (but not de-
stroy) the buran with any form of 
Supernatural Power (magical, Di-
vine, or otherwise) treats the demon’s 
Might as if it were 150% its actual 
Might, or otherwise has its Ease Fac-
tor increased by 50%. For example, 
a Circular Ward Against Demons of 38th 
level is needed to stop this buran 
with Might 25.
Weaknesses: Protected Group (indi-
viduals that invoke the Bismillah 
invocation)
Vis: 5 pawns of Auram vis prava, left be-
hind as black sand when dispersed.
Appearance: Usually manifests as a gi-
ant shapeless vortex of raging black 
sand using its Auram powers. To 
those with Second Sight, a giant 
humanoid shadow can be discerned 
within the sandstorm.
Unlike many other corrupt jinn, the 
buran lacks the Coagulation and Obsession 
powers common to most demons and is 
an insubstantial spirit, unable to affect 
the physical world except through its 
magic. It is an example of an Infernal 
storm spirit likely to be found in the 
Taklamakan Desert, although much 
stronger and less powerful creatures 
also exist (see Chapter 9: On the Silk 
Road). Many travelers’ tales tell of com-
panions fallen behind who are tempted 
off the track by the illusions created by 
these demons.
Those storm spirits aligned to the 
Magic realm may have very similar char-
acteristics, although they lack the Recal-
citrance power and the brutal malevo-
lence of their demonic cousins. Similar 
spirits aligned to other elemental Forms 
can be represented with modifications to 
these statistics.
Story Seed: The  
Corruption of the West
European demons of Christian ori-
gin are becoming increasingly common 
in the Levant since the advent of the 
Crusades, but have yet to penetrate past 
the borders of Outremer. Apart from a 
handful of Jewish demons and Infernal 
entities from ancient Persian mythol-
ogy, the vast majority of Infernal crea-
tures in the Mythic Middle East are in 
fact Infernal jinn and thus susceptible 
to Sihr, as commonly practiced by the 
Order of Suleiman. 
All this will change as merchants, 
missionaries and Hermetic magi pen-
etrate further east, bringing with them 
their own legacies of sin and corruption 
that may change the balance of mysti-
cal power in the Mythic Middle East. 
The Unholy Trinity (see Chapter 1: 
Saga and Introduction) are a group of 
demons drawing on western concep-
tions of Islam that may have a large 
role to play in increasing the number of 
non-jinn Infernal spirits of the Mythic 
Middle East.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Learning from Jinn
As creatures of embodied magical 
power, all jinn, regardless of Realm align-
ment, can act as sources of study, akin to 
the observation of magically occurring 
phenomena referred to by Hermetic magi 
as significatos (Covenants, page 101). Each 
individual jinni acts as the equivalent of 
a tractatus on a single appropriate Her-
metic Form (typically an elemental Form 
for Magic jinn, Imaginem for Faerie jinn, 
and Vim for Infernal jinn), the Acceler-
ated Ability Sihr and their aligned (Realm) 
Lore. The jinni does not teach the sum-
moner, nor does it need to possess a score 
in the relevant Art or Ability, as it is the 
summoner’s observation of the Essential 
Nature of the jinni rather than the jinni’s 
knowledge that is the key. The summoner 
may only gain the benefit for one Ability 
or Art per season.
To gain the benefits of study, a sahir 
or other summoner must coerce a jinni 
or jinniyya into service for a whole sea-
son. Such coercion may be in the form 
of a non-magical bargain, Sihr, Hermetic 
Rego magic with an appropriate duration, 
the non-Hermetic Goetic Art of Com-
manding, or the Hedge Art of Elemen-
tal Controlling (for Magic jinn associ-
ated with an elemental Form). Mundane 
threats able to be enforced by effective 
Rego or Perdo magic may be used to 
force an appropriate non-magical bar-
gain, although the jinni will seek revenge 
on its enslaver.
A jinni can only instruct its master 
once for each Ability or Art.
Source Quality of a Jinni:  
3 x magnitude of Might
Corrupt Jinn
In Ars Magica terms, corrupt jinn in-
clude those terrestrial demons strongly 
aligned to Arab folklore and medieval Is-
lamic culture found in Islamic lands. Many 
demonic-appearing jinn are actually dark 
Faerie creatures, who choose to accept or 
reject the Islamic faith as part of their role 
within stories involving humans. Making 
the correct distinction between jinn of 
different Realm alignment can be difficult 
for even experienced sahir but once a jinni 
aligns with the Infernal, it has irrevocably 
transformed into a true demon. 
All Infernal jinn share the following 
Vulnerabilities in addition to the Virtues 
and Flaws noted earlier for all jinn: Bis-
millah Invocation and Iron. Most Infer-
nal jinn similarly suffer from the Minor 
Flaw Vulnerable to Folk Tradition. Dark 
Faerie jinn have Virtues, Flaws and Pow-
ers similar to their pious jinn cousins de-
tailed earlier.
Infernal jinni counterparts to the fol-
lowing demons found in Realms of Power: 
the Infernal can be encountered through-
out the Mythic Middle East: mazzikim, 
succubi and lesser evil spirits would be 
classed as shaitan, whereas many ‘afrit 
with close elemental ties are best repre-
sented by Aerial Powers or perhaps pow-
erful False Gods with additional powers 
related to elemental control. 
Aside from their appearance and the 
modifications noted earlier, these jinn 
can be represented by the same statistics 
as their European cousins. Further details 
on demons are given in Realms of Power: 
The Infernal.
The Dangers of Distinction: 
Dark Faerie or Infernal?
The distinction between dark Faerie 
jinn and truly Infernal jinn can be diffi-
cult, as both types of creatures are com-
monly referred to as shaitan (“demon”) 
by the common folk of medieval Islam 
and are depicted as such in the various 
stories. Many Infernal jinn, including per-
haps Iblis himself, were once dark Faeries 
and many Infernal jinn have dark Faerie 
counterparts who draw vitality from sto-
ries arising out of the activities usually 
ascribed to demons. 
In general, the actions of dark Faerie 
jinn are impersonal and instinctive. Such 
entities act in a way that may encourage 
humans to sin because it suits their role 
in their chosen story and they feed off 
the vitality created by such emotions as 
guilt, greed, cruelty and lust. As such, 
most dark Faerie jinn are Incognizant or 
only Narrowly Cognizant — they are 
unable to change their roles, advance 
or evolve into other forms (see Realms 
of Power: Faerie for additional details). In-
fernal jinn, on the other hand, are those 
creatures who intentionally inspire hu-
mans to sin, manipulating them to make 
them fall. 
The distinction between a Highly 
Cognizant dark Faerie jinni and Infernal 
jinni is a difficult one — many such Faerie 
creatures quickly lose themselves to the 
forces of Iblis. The term “shaitan” confus-
ingly refers to both types of creature and 
the ambiguity and danger this creates 
for sahir characters is intentional. The 
Sihr of a sahir will work on both types of 
creature, although the actual Realm Lore 
required for the ritual may be mistaken 
by the character, producing unexpected 
outcomes when the summoner fails her 
control attempt because a creature as-
sumed to be a dark Faerie turns out to 
be Infernal. 
Ghula, Faerie
These dark Faerie jinn may rise from, 
or impersonate, those who die of thirst in 
the desert. They seek virile and wealthy 
husbands. They drain the blood of their 
husbands as they sleep. Once sufficient 
vitality has been consumed, the ghula can 
have a baby. The baby appears to share 
the characteristics of the human parent, 
but it is a faerie, a ghula like its mother. 
Baby ghuls are born with teeth.
The ghulas in a city sneak out of their 
houses while their husbands sleep. They 
gather in graveyards to feast, cavort and 
drain the blood from corpses. In most 
versions of their story, the husband of 
a ghula discovers these night meetings, 
and destroys the nest of ghuls, but can-
not bring himself to kill his child. The 
young ghula grows to adulthood, and 
tyrannize the city, forcing the man who 
discovered the ghuls to flee. This old, 
sick, broken man lives near the town, 
warning travelers away, and reciting his 
role in his home’s downfall. In doing this, 
he spreads the fame of the ghuls, which 
gives them vitality.
A related story says that ghulas are 
the ghosts of prostitutes, given solid form,

The Cradle & The Crescent
and that they are simpler in their preda-
tory behavior. They merely eat the dead, 
and lacking fresh prey eat corpses. They 
use their wiles to lure men of weak faith 
to hidden places and have a power that 
causes sleep, allowing them to crush the 
heads of their victims with stones. 
Faerie ghula statistics first appeared in 
Realms of Power: Faerie, page 72.
Ghul, Infernal 
An Infernal ghul (fem., ghula, pl., ghuls 
or ghilan) is a degenerate jinni, a corrupt 
and cannibalistic creature of the night. 
They are believed to be descendants of a 
depraved tribe of primitive jinn given over 
to the Infernal. Solitary by nature, they 
haunt cemeteries, garbage pits and slums 
preying on the weak or feeding off carri-
on. Hideous to behold, they often disguise 
themselves in heavy robes as lost travelers, 
women in distress, or kindly dervishes to 
waylay travelers with the aid of their pow-

Appearance: Ghulas usually look like 
beautiful women. To attract husbands, 
ghulas pretend to be wealthy widows 
or orphans of good family, in need of 
husbands. Ghulas often pretend to be 
members of communities displaced 
by war, as it gives their story verisimil-
itude. The eyes and the insides of the 
mouths of Arabic ghulas are always 
green. Male Faerie ghuls exist, but are 
the servants of the ghulas, and rarely 
play the role of seducer. See later for 
an example of an Infernal male ghul.
Ghulas are not designed as player char-
acters. The version represented here differs 
slightly from the European ghulas or lamiae 
originally presented in that she reflects the 
Arab conception of her as an evil jinniyya. 
Although a form of Faerie spirit, ghulas are 
locked in a physical manifestation.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Ghul, Infernal
Infernal Might: not more than 20 usually
Order: Furies
Weaknesses: Protected Group (individu-
als that invoke the Bismillah Invoca-
tion), Vulnerability (Iron)
Abilities: Arabic 5 (deception), Brawl 
6 (claws), Charm 4 (trust), Stealth 
4 (urban areas), Theology: Islam 1 
(jinn). Other Abilities depend on the 
individual ghul
Powers: 
Berserker Rage, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem: 
The demon can grant anyone (usu-
ally itself or its animal companions) 
the Berserk Virtue, which persists un-
til the target calms down. 
Change Form, 0 points, Init 0, Corpus 
or Animal: A ghul can change his 
physical form at will, to whatever 
human or animal form he desires. 
Most ghul are limited to changing 
form into one type of creature (any 
human female form, any bird form, 
any canine form, for example), but 
more powerful individuals have been 
known to adopt multiple shapes. The 
Size of the form is limited to what-
ever is natural for the species, so a 
human-sized ghul taking adult hu-
man form must be between Size –2 
and +2. This transformation is not 
akin to a magical spell; it is a natural 
manipulation of the physical matter 
that makes up the demon’s body, and 
consequently Magic Resistance does 
not stop physical attacks from shape-
changed ghul as there is no ongoing 
magical effect.
Endurance of the Enraged, 0 points, Init 
0, Corpus: The ghul do not suffer 
from wound penalties, except on 
Defense totals. 
Restoration, 10 points, Init +0, Corpus: 
When a ghul uses this power, the 
next blow will heal the wound he 
suffered the last time he was hurt. 
Each use of this power is only good 
for one damaging blow. 
Appearance: A common ghul is a tall 
feral creature, hunched over with 
overlong arms ending in cruel iron 
claws. It wears rags or rent robes 
stained with marrow, blood and dirt 
from the graves it digs up. More 
intelligent and magical examples 
appear more human but still have 
sharply angular features, promi-
nently pointed or serrated teeth, and 
long curved nails. 
This character guide is for an Infer-
nal male version of the ghul and differs 
substantially from the similarly named 
female Faerie ghula earlier. Whereas 
the latter are female-appearing Faerie 
creatures that eat their spouses, these 
Infernal creatures act as primal destroy-
ers and are found more commonly in 
male forms. The exact relationship 
between the two types of creature 
is unclear — Infernal ghul may have 
evolved from corrupt Faerie creatures 
or they may simply be different enti-
ties that appear to share similar forms 
and characteristics.
Unlike members of dark Faerie-
aligned jinn tribes, this ghul is a true ‘’ter-
restrial demon’’ (Realms of Power: The Infer-
nal, page 28) and loosely belongs to the 
Order of Furies, sharing several of the 
traits and powers of that class of demons. 
Unlike most demons and other Infernal 
jinn, although a spiritual creature, an In-
fernal ghul cannot assume incorporeal 
form and does not possess the Coagulation 
power. This example lacks the Envisioning 
and Obsession powers of most common 
demons but other individuals may have 
these powers or additional deceptive 
powers or skills instead. 
Exceptional individuals exhibit ad-
ditional magical abilities over rock and 
flesh (as Crafter/Master of Earth and/or 
Crafter/Master of Flesh), illusions, pos-
session, or they have learned some of 
the magic of humans (Dowsing, Hex, 
Malefica, or otherwise represented by 
the equivalent of a Duplicate the Magi’s 
(Technique) power). The most danger-
ous and feared ghul are those who have 
gained power over other jinn by learn-
ing one of the summoning Arts — Sihr, 
the Arts Fabulosa, or more commonly, 
the Goetic Arts of Commanding or of 
Spirit Summoning.
The Varied Guises of Iblis
At the troupe’s option, different ver-
sions of Iblis may exist simultaneously in 
a saga. In the guise of lesser faeries claim-
ing his name, the character Iblis appears 
in a number of minor roles in the folk-
lore of the Islamic lands. In some stories 
he may be the Islamic Devil or embody 
a great duke of the Deluders, while in 
other tales he is a powerful dark faerie 
monarch or a faerie opponent posing as 
a lesser demon.
One such tale is that of “The Old 
Woman and the Devil”, where a very fal-
lible Iblis is challenged by an old woman 
to show who is the craftier. The old 
woman tricks a merchant and his wife, 
but later undoes the harm she has caused, 
thus proving that “the devil is no match 
for an old woman.” This lesser Faerie Ib-
lis can only destroy or create strife in the 
stories, but never undo evil or perform 
good deeds.
Story Seed: The Dark Sufis
You may wish to introduce into 
your saga a misguided Sufi tradition, 
made up of individuals who respect Ib-
lis for his refusal to bow down to Adam, 
assuming that it was his love for Allah 
that motivated his decision not to bow 
to anyone but his God. Such heretical 
mystics could comprise a Misguided In-
fernal Tradition of unwitting diabolists 
similar to the Luciferans. The mystical 
powers of such Infernal Sufis could be 
reflected by the Favoured Abilities: In-
cantation, Effusion, Phantasm and Cer-
emony. (See Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
pages 127–131). Posing as a holy man, 
a Dark Sufi may contact a Criamon 
character, seeking to lead the magus 
into corruption.

ers of deception and mimicry. 
All ghuls can assume the form of at 
least one scavenger native to their area, 
dog, hyena, jackal or vulture, and ex-
cel at assuming the forms of humans to 
conceal their debased nature. They dis-
dain weapons and hunt and fight with 
claw like nails and jagged teeth. Folklore 
tells that many ghuls, if wounded with 
a weapon but not killed outright with a 
single blow, will be healed when struck 
a second blow, making them dangerous 
opponents for lone victims.
Qareen
The Messenger of Allah said, ‘There is 
not one of you who does not have a jinni 
appointed to be his constant companion.’ 
They said, ‘And you too, O Messenger 
of Allah?’ He said, ‘Me too, but Allah has 
helped me and he has submitted, so that 
he only helps me to do good.’
	
	
— Ibn Mas’ood
And whosoever turns away blindly 
from the remembrance of the Most Gra-
cious (Allah) (i.e., this Qur’an and adora-
tion of Allah), We appoint for him a Shai-
tan (“Satan — devil — unruly — defiant”) 
to be a Qareen (a companion) to him. 
	
	
— The Qur’an
Qareen is the Arabic name for a spirit 
believed to be assigned to an individual 
Muslim as a “constant companion” — a 
personal tempter, intent on enticing him to 
sin. According to the hadith, every human 
has a jinni appointed to accompany him 
through life and test him, tempting him 
away from the path of God. Considered 
part of the tribe of Shaitan, such qareen are 
dark Faerie creatures akin to the shedim 
demons of Judaism (Realms of Power: Infernal, 
page 57). Most characters are unaware of 
their qareen, but some have more irksome 
companions reflected by possession of Ma-
jor Story Flaw Plagued by Supernatural En-
tity (Qareen), or possible the Minor Story 
Flaw Faerie Friend. Most of these jinn are 
playful and mischievous rather than cor-
rupting and provoke stories of temptation, 
reflection and forbearance. Nearly all qa-
reen belong to the Faerie Realm, but some 
A Typical Demonic Qareen
Most people are not aware of their 
qareen; the following creature is ap-
propriate for those who have the Ma-
jor Story Flaw Plagued by a Supernatu-
ral Entity (Qareen). These characters 
have qareen that they are consciously 
aware of, that they can see, and that 
actively try to cause them to stray 
from the path of good. Less obtrusive 
Infernal qareen may be reflected by 
either the Impious Friend or Manu-
factured Ignorance Flaw, and have 
Might scores in the range of 5 to 10. 
An affected individual hears whispers 
from his qareen, using its Envisioning 
Power, and such comments appear to 
come from the victim’s own head (and 
should be provided as advice from the 
storyguide with nary a mention of a de-
mon involved).
Order: Tempters (Shaitan / Qareen)
Infernal Might: usually 15 (Vim)
Characteristics: Int +1, Per +1, Pre +2, 
+3, Str na, Sta na, Dex na, Qik +2
Weakness: Protected Group (victims 
who willingly and totally reject the 
qareen, fueling the rejection with a 
Faith Point), common jinni Weak-
nesses (see later).
Abilities: Vary for individual qareen 
and may complement those of its 
companion. In general, a qareen 
may have up to 300 XP of Abilities 
that it may use to aid or hinder its 
chosen human. 
Powers:
Apparition, 1 point, Init 0, Imaginem; 
Qareen may assume an illusory 
form that only their companion 
can perceive. To the victims, the 
form appears to be a real person in 
all respects.
Control Human, 2 points, Init +2, Men-
tem; If this power penetrates, the 
qareen exerts direct control over its 
companion. It can issue commands 
that the target carries out to the best 
of his abilities. However, the target 
can attempt to break the control of 
the jinni every time he is asked to 
do something contrary to the tenets 
of his faith.
Envisioning, 1 or 5 points, Init +2, Men-
tem; This Power allows the qareen 
to appear in the dreams of its sleep-
ing companion (in which case it 
costs 1 point), or make the target 
experience a waking dream or vision 
(in which case it costs 5 points). 
The qareen cannot instantly make 
substantial changes to a dream, but 
instead gradually twists it to take on 
a darker and more frightening tone, 
and can speak through any figure 
from the victim’s subconscious. A 
waking dream is more obvious; the 
victim suffers an immediate and 
powerful hallucination of whatever 
the demon desires. This may be so 
frightening that the victim is stunned 
for a round, and must make a Brave 
Personality roll against an Ease Fac-
tor of 9 or have an extreme reaction, 
such as retching, convulsions, or ab-
ject terror. This is the preferred way 
for a qareen to communicate with its 
chosen companion.
Protection of the Appointed Companion, 0 
points, Init +2, Mentem; The com-
panion of a qareen cannot act di-
rectly against it without extreme 
provocation; it would be akin to 
attacking one’s own mother. The 
victim may be as angry as they like 
with the jinni, but actually physi-
cally opposing it requires a huge 
effort of will, and the expenditure 
of a Confidence point, which must 
be repeated every time the victim 
wants to renew his attacks.
Appearance: A qareen is an incorpo-
real spirit, appearing to those with 
Second Sight or means to see the 
invisible as a pallid reflection of its 
chosen companion. To its victim, 
a qareen uses its powers to appear 
either pleasing or terrifying depend-
ing on its motivations and schemes. 
Unlike many other demons, it lacks 
the Coagulation power and cannot 
form a physical body.

The Cradle & The Crescent
have become corrupted and have become 
aligned to the Infernal, transforming into 
true demons. There are no Divine or Mag-
ic Realm aligned qareen. 
Each of these companion spirits has 
slightly different powers but shares the typi-
cal Weaknesses of jinn (detailed earlier). Ex-
amples of the powers of an Infernal qareen 
are given later — Faerie qareen have almost 
identical base powers, only a differing Realm 
alignment and motivation for testing their 
chosen victim. Unlike many other jinn, a 
qareen cannot assume physical form as they 
either lack the Coagulation power of most 
demons or the Donning the Corporeal Veil 
power common to many faeries. 
Some qareen have additional powers 
— the qareen that accompanied the an-
cient Arabian kahin (pre-Islamic “seers”) 
are believed to possess the following pow-
ers or their Faerie equivalents: The Serpent’s 
Oracle, Trust of the Innocent and Forked Tongue 
of the Serpent — powers normally attributed 
to the Spirits of Deceit (See Realms of Power: 
The Infernal, page 38).
A qareen is left powerless if its victim 
makes a concerted positive effort to throw 
off the malevolent jinni’s inﬂuence. This 
requires the spending of a point of Faith 
(perhaps a point of Faith acquired by re-
penting of the sins committed while influ-
enced by the qareen). Confidence alone is 
not enough to shake off the influence of 
the companion shaitan, unlike the Jewish 
shedim. In effect a qareen is a special form 
of Infernal or Faerie genius loci with a lo-
cus linked to its assigned human compan-
ion allowing it to travel the world.
Wizards and Qareen
Islamic sahirs are keenly aware of qa-
reen and many have the ability to per-
ceive the true form of their accompanying 
tempter, either through Second Sight or 
their other magic. Most qareen accompa-
nying wizards are malevolent, reflected by 
the Flaws detailed earlier. As jinn, they can 
be coerced with magic, bargained with 
and even imprisoned using the appropriate 
supernatural powers, but at the sahir’s own 
risk. See Chapter 3: The Order of Sulei-
man for further details on sahirs and their 
potential to form magical khadim bonds 
with qareen that allow them to boost their 
Solomonic magic by drawing on the reluc-
tant jinni’s Might. Qareen do not make the 
greatest candidates for the khadim bond 
but many young sahirs see the magical 
servitude as a means of making the most 
out of the pestering spirits.
Jinni Weaknesses
Bismi-llāhi ar-raḥmāni ar-raḥīmi!
(In the name of God, Most Gracious, 
Most Merciful!)
— The opening invocation common 
            to all but one sura of the Qur’an
Faerie-aligned jinn possess a weakness 
to the Bismillah Invocation, reflected by 
their Traditional Ward Minor Flaw (Bis-
millah Invocation) and all Infernal jinn 
have an equivalent Vulnerability to this 
folk practice of “naming,” the invocation 
of God’s name that opens most chapters 
of the Qur’an. 
Faerie and Infernal jinn cannot act 
against an individual who has uttered this 
phrase before encountering the spirit, 
similar to the Protected Group Weakness 
of demons — none of their Supernatural 
Powers work on these individuals, and 
they can only defend themselves in com-
bat if attacked (Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
Story Seed: A Pious Companion?
Rarely, an exceptionally pious 
character may be able to convince her 
dark Faerie qareen to accept the error 
of his ways and appear to submit to 
Islam. As all Faerie-aligned jinn, even 
Faerie members of the predominantly 
corrupt jinni tribes such as Shaitan, 
have been granted free choice, this is a 
potential long-term story option. Such 
benevolent qareen become the equiva-
lent of highly cognizant Faerie guard-
ians. Being pious jinn rather than true 
Divine spirits, their power is aligned 
to the Faerie Realm and not the Divine 
Realm, although they may be mistaken 
for guardian angels by the unwise. In-
fernal qareen, as they are true demons, 
do not have free choice and so cannot 
be redeemed.
Submitted Qareen
Major Supernatural Virtue
Your Faerie qareen or accompanying 
jinni has submitted to Islam. Like a vari-
ant Ghostly Warder (ArM5 page 94) it 
can guide and assist you with its powers, 
but cannot provide general Magic Resis-
tance, as it is not a creature of the Di-
vine or Infernal realms. Such qareen can 
easily be designed using the Ghostly 
Warder (ArM5 page 193) or else creat-
ed as Companion-level characters using 
the rules for creating Faerie Characters 
(Realms of Power: Faerie, page 43-63), typi-
cally possessing the following Virtues 
& Flaws: Faerie Speech, Highly Cogni-
zant, Lesser Power x2 (Eidolon, Guide); 
Intangible Flesh, Negative Reaction.
Story Seed: An Unwanted Guest,  
and an Unexpected Invitation
Although Christian, Jewish, or pagan 
summoners native to Islamic lands may 
also possess a qareen, at the troupe’s dis-
cretion, a Hermetic magus may discover 
upon arriving in the Mythic Middle East 
that a Faerie qareen has attached itself 
to him, despite his status as an unbeliev-
er. Magi with the Spirit Familiar or the 
Theurgic Spirit Familiar Mystery Vir-
tues (The Mysteries: Revised Edition, pages 
66–69, 81–82) can attempt to bind In-
fernal qareen as their spirit familiar but 
only magi with Faerie Magic can bind 
submitted qareen or dark Faerie qareen. 
Demonstration of power over a qareen 
is sufficient grounds for membership in 
the Order of Suleiman and the character 
may find himself the recipient of a cor-
dial invitation to join a group of open-
minded sahirs.

The Cradle & The Crescent
page 34). This protection has a conditional 
duration of Until (leaves immediate locale 
of the jinni or completes a specific action) 
or until the time of the next daily prayer, 
whichever is sooner. 
To pronounce the Bismillah correctly 
requires a poetic grasp of the language of 
the Qur’an, reflected by an Arabic score of 
6 or more and a successful Com + Theol-
ogy: Islam stress die roll against an Ease 
Factor of 6. The Bismillah can only be in-
voked prior to recognizing a jinni and is 
ineffective if the character is surprised by 
a jinni.
Devout Muslims are instructed to ut-
ter this phrase before entering locales 
where jinn are believed to live such as 
ruins, lavatories, cemeteries, deserts, and 
caves, but only those with the required 
fluency in Arabic and a decent grasp of 
Islamic theology can actually benefit from 
this magical protection. 
Other Folk Traditions  
That Ward against Jinn 
Arab folklore abounds with addi-
tional folk remedies for jinni curses and 
powers. Many lesser jinn are affected by 
the Minor Flaw Vulnerable to Folk Tradi-
tion (see later) or suffer from the Vulner-
able Magic (mu’addhin’s call) Major Flaw, 
their magic expiring at sunrise with the 
crow of a cockerel or with the morning 
call to prayer from the minaret of the lo-
cal mosque. Muslim characters may use 
either the appropriate Realm Lore or their 
Theology: Islam score to try to dispel 
the malign effects of such jinni enchant-
ments. Magic jinn are not so severely af-
fected, but a properly worded invocation 
of the Qur’an can grant some protection 
against their powers.
The following four suras of the 
Qur’an, known as the “Four Quls” (each 
begins with “Say:”) are effective wards 
against jinn and perhaps other spirits — 
each provides a +3 bonus if successfully 
recalled when invoking the Khawass al-
Qur’an as a holy forebearer for the baraka 
Acknowledgement of Evil, Celestial Immunity, 
Expel Demons or Resist Temptation (See Realms 
of Power: The Divine, pages 103–105, for 
details of baraka). The four specific suras 
are: al-Mu’aumidhatayn (the al-Falaq (113th 
sura) and an-Nas (114th / last sura) pair-
ing), al-Kafraa (109th sura) and al-Ikhlaas 
(112th sura).
The Ayat al-Qursi or “Throne Verse” 
(255th verse) of al-Baqarah (2nd sura) 
and the last two verses of the same sura 
are similarly potent wards against jinn. A 
Muslim character who has memorized and 
correctly recites 50 ayat (verses) of the 
Qur’an receives the same benefit.
Each sura takes a considerable amount 
of time to recite and requires the individ-
ual to have memorized and the recall the 
specific verses using their Art of Memory 
or Theology: Islam score (see The Myster-
ies: Revised Edition, pages 25–26). Characters 
with an Arabic score of 6 or greater gain a 
+2 to their roll.
Jinn and Other  
Expressions of the Divine
Due to their strong cultural allegianc-
es, all Faerie and Infernal jinn are vulner-
able to other strong expressions of the 
Islamic faith. No such jinn can use their 
powers to affect a hajji, a Muslim who has 
completed the pilgrimage to Mecca within 
the last year (see Chapter 1: Introduction 
and Saga). 
A Muslim character who focuses his 
prayers through correct recital of a sura of 
the Qur’an and who successfully invokes 
God’s aid to defeat a jinni (See Realms of 
Power: The Divine, page 41) gains twice the 
usual bonus. 
Faerie jinn are strangely unaffected by 
other religious demonstrations — Chris-
tian, Jewish or Zoroastrian — whereas In-
fernal jinn as demons may be affected by 
such holy displays. Infernal jinn remain 
susceptible to the Scourging the Infernal 
power of relics but simple objects of faith 
have no special power over these crea-
tures (Realms of Power: The Infernal, pages 
33-34). 
Unless otherwise noted, Magic jinn 
are not susceptible to these restrictions but 
may suffer other flaws reflecting a vulnera-
bility to the power of the Divine. Whether 
these vulnerabilities stem from the power 
granted to Suleiman over their ancestors 
or the apparent conversion of large num-
bers within the jinni tribes in recent times 
is unclear. 
Lands of  
the Jinn
The following locations are particu-
larly associated with the jinn.
Jinnistan
The jinn dwell in places just past 
the ken of humans — out of the corner 
of the eye, behind the doors impossibly 
squeezed between two seemingly normal 
houses, or just around the last corner of 
one of the alleys leading off the bazaar. 
They visit the mundane realm often but 
their real homes may lie underground, 
amid the beauty of the wilderness, within 
dark ruins or even beyond the mundane 
realm in regiones and the Supernatural 
Realms. All these locales are collectively 
referred to as Jinnistan.
Judging from the tales, although it 
may once have been part of the Magic 
Realm, Jinnistan may now lie mainly in 
the Realm of Arcadia, but seems to have 
branched into the Realm of Eudokia and 
perhaps even into parts of Hell. Its geog-
raphy is as varied as the mundane realm 
and its inhabitants pursue lives similar to 
their non-magical brethren of the Mythic 
Middle East, often passing freely between 
their magical homeland and their mun-
dane neighborhood.
Whole cities of jinn, such as Am-
erabad, the City of Amber, are found 
within its fluid borders and parts of other 
lost and legendary cities such as Golden 
Baghdad (see Chapter 7: Mythic Meso-
potamia) and Khashgar, the nexus of the 
fabled Silk Route (see Chapter 9: On the 
Silk Road), form a background for many 
of the tales involving jinn. Some travel-
ers claim that Jinnistan can be reached 
by traveling beyond the Great Rivers, the 
eastern mountains or sailing beyond the 
edge of the ocean.
These claims are all true, but false all 
the same. Where there are jinn, there is 
Jinnistan.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Mountains of Qaf
Muslim folklore describes this chain 
of peaks encircling the known lands, 
forming a barrier between the lands of the 
humans and the supernatural homes of 
the jinn. Impassable, foreboding, and pur-
portedly emerald green in color, mundane 
geographers have attempted to place this 
mythical site variously in the Caucasus, 
the Pamir, the Paropamisadae and even 
the distant Urals or the Atlas Mountains 
of North Africa. 
Classical scholars equate this range 
with the legendary Mount Imeon or the 
Caucasus Indicus of the Greeks — the 
great eastern barrier of the world of Alex-
ander the Great (see Chapter 9: On the 
Silk Road). 
Perhaps the Qaf are not one mountain 
chain but are the Essential mountain range, 
the embodiment of the concept of moun-
tains within the Magic Realm, past which 
lie whole different worlds. Alternatively, 
they may be the Faerie Realm’s distillation 
of all the tales of impassable mountains 
told since antiquity.
Al-Khadar
Outside the circle of the known 
world, past the pale blue waters that line 
the coast of Persia and beyond the trade 
waters of the Erythraean Sea, lies the great 
ocean of Al-Khadar (“the Green”), a mag-
ical and metaphorical barrier breached 
only by jinn, adventurers, sorcerers, and 
Islamic saints. Few claim to have traveled 
to its distant shores or floating islands 
laden with human-headed trees and in-
telligent apes. Those who claim to have 
returned report their ordeals in allegory 
and lies, such as in the travels of Sinbad 
the Sailor.
Islamic cosmology speaks of whole 
worlds beyond that which contains 
Mythic Europe and the Mythic Middle 
East — worlds inhabited by fearsome an-
gels, strange humans, exotic jinn and even 
more alien beings. Hermetic scholars of 
the Keeper of Tales mystery cult suggest 
that these lands lie within the Faerie realm 
of Eudokia. 
Criamon magi point to “The Tale of 
Buluqya” as a possible itinerary for magi 
wishing to travel into the mysterious Mag-
ic Realm, claiming its metaphorical tone 
contains a pathway that leads outside the 
Circle of Time. 
Mortal Scions  
of the Jinn
An exotic Merinita maga, Arabian Ex 
Miscellanea magus or hedge wizard hail-
ing from the Mythic Middle East pos-
sessing a jinni variant of Faerie Blood or 
Strong Faerie Blood (see later) may make 
an interesting character to play in an Ara-
bian saga. Designed with a suite of accom-
panying themed powers, such a character 
may also be played as an exotic outsider in 
a game set in western Europe. Such char-
acters may possess only a jinni-themed 
Faerie background or may have a whole 
collection of Benedictions and other pow-
ers ruled by Charms with a jinni flavor. All 
the Virtues and Flaws used in the descrip-
tions of Faerie jinn earlier could be suit-
able for such a strongly themed character. 
Such characters would be susceptible to 
Faerie Calling through Warping, unless 
specifically created as a Hermetic magus. 
In this case, they suffer Wizard’s Twilight 
instead. Further ideas and details on such 
jinni-themed Faerie touched characters 
can be adapted from Realms of Power: Faerie, 
Chapter 5: Touches of Faerie.
The paragraphs later describe some 
optional jinni varieties of the Faerie Blood 
Virtue — adding new varieties to those 
found on page 42 of ArM5. The specific 
benefit of possessing Faerie Blood of each 
type is listed, along with the enhanced 
version for those characters that have the 
Faerie Legacy Virtue. Note that this en-
hanced effect replaces the normal benefit 
of Faerie Blood; it is not in addition to it. 
Each listing also has some typical Sym-
pathies, and some suggestions for other 
Virtues and Flaws possessed by different 
faerie bloodlines. Finally, since characters 
with Strong Faerie Blood gain a distinctive 
appearance from that Virtue some com-
mon features are given; these could also 
be used for characters with regular Faerie 
Blood who also have the Disfigured Flaw. 
Further information on Faerie Blood, 
Faerie Legacy and Faerie Sympathies can 
be found in Realms of Power: Faerie, Chapter 
5: Touches of Faerie.
‘Afrit Blood
The ‘afrit are ranked among the more 
powerful of the jinn and many have mon-
strous oversized appearance and a cruel 
nature. Although not necessarily evil, they 
are often indifferent to humans or consider 
them inferior.
Benefits: +1 to Strength or Intelli-
gence, but not to more than +3
Legacy: +1 bonus to Strength or Intel-
ligence, can go as high as +4
Sympathies: Power, Cruelty, Patience 
(negative)
Other Virtues and Flaws: Greater 
Benediction: Flight, Greater Immunity: 
Weapons (bludgeoning or piercing or slash-
ing), Ways of the Desert; Frightful Presence, 
Huge, Large, Second Sight; Monstrous Ap-
pearance; Faerie Heritage, Susceptible to 
the Divine, Vulnerable to Folk Tradition 
(naming or Bismillah Invocation)
Appearance: Tall or large in girth, of-
ten horned, reddish complexion
Ghula Blood
The ghulas are rapacious wasteland fa-
eries of the Arab world. Sexual encounters 
between human men and female Faerie 
ghulas (see earlier) result in either another 
ghula (if the child is a girl) or ghul-blood-
ed humans (if a boy is born). The sons of 
ghulas can then go on to produce either 
girls or boys with ghul blood. This variety 
of faerie blood could also represent other 
violent faerie ancestors. Those with ghul 
blood are nearly always sinister-looking, 
born with teeth and unusually aware of 
their surroundings. 
The template reflects a character de-
scended from a Faerie ghula rather than 
the offspring of an Infernal ghul. Charac-
ters born of Infernal ghul may best be pre-
sented as Devil Children (see later).
Benefits: Claws that can be retracted and 
extended at will, these have the fol-
lowing weapon statistics: Init –1, Atk 
+2, Dfn +3, Dam +2.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Legacy: As earlier, except that the claws 
are extra large, and the Damage bonus 
is +4 rather than +2.
Sympathies: Wastelands, Stalking, Com-
passion (negative)
Other Virtues and Flaws: Ways of the 
Desert; Skinchanger (hyena or vul-
ture); Nocturnal, Poor Presence
Appearance: dark skin, wrinkled, sharp 
teeth, green on the inside of the 
mouth, always have green eyes. 
Jann Blood
The jann are lesser Faerie jinn, mem-
bers of a tribe that closely mimics human 
culture and behavior to the extent of fol-
lowing Islam, herding camels and living 
the nomadic lifestyle of Bedouin. As such, 
they are the most likely type of jinn to pro-
duce offspring with Faerie Blood or adopt 
foundlings into their tribe. Many Faerie 
sorcerers of Mythic Arabia are believed to 
be scions of the jann and many beautiful 
women, including the legendary Balqis, 
Queen of Sheba, claim jann parentage.
Benefits: +1 to Presence, but not to more 
than +3
Legacy: +1 bonus to Presence, can go as 
high as +4
Sympathies: Deserts, Hospitality, Tem-
perance (negative)
Other Virtues and Flaws: Supernatural 
Beauty, Ways of the Desert; Faerie 
Speech, Persona, Second Sight, Skin-
changer (camel, eagle); Envied Beauty; 
Disfigured (one animal feature), Du-
tybound (Bedouin honor), Susceptible 
to the Divine, Vulnerable to Folk Tra-
dition (Naming) or Vulnerable Magic: 
Mu’addhin’s Call
Appearance: Swarthy, deeply tanned, 
piercing blue eyes
Mythic Scions  
of the Jinn
Faerie jinn and characters descended 
from them are well-suited for use as player 
characters in sagas involving the Mythic 
Middle East. Such characters could be 
created as a companion- or magus-level 
character using the balanced rules provid-
ed in Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 43–63, 
and incorporating the suggested inherent 
Pretenses and Required Virtues and Flaws 
noted in the sections earlier.
Players wishing to create a character 
with ties to an elemental jinni aligned to 
the Magic Realm can design a Mythic 
Companion, using the Blood of Heroes 
Special Virtue from Houses of Hermes: True 
Lineages (or the Mythic Blood Virtue for 
Hermetic magi) or the Magic Blooded Vir-
tue from Realms of Power: Magic, and choose 
appropriately-themed Virtues and Flaws. 
Some of the Elemental Virtues from Hedge 
Magic Revised Edition may be particularly 
appropriate for such characters. A Gifted 
Companion or Mythic Companion Char-
acter using the Spirit Votary Major Virtue 
from Realms of Power: Magic could similarly 
be used to represent a pagan priest de-
voted to an elemental jinni recognized as 
a pre-Islamic Arab divinity, perhaps even

The Cradle & The Crescent
claiming descent from such ancient gods.
Mortal characters descended from In-
fernal jinn or truly demonic jinn are best 
represented by the rules for Devil Chil-
dren, given in Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
page 99–101, and begin with the Devil 
Child Special Virtue, Demonic Blood and 
the following starting Virtues and Flaws: 
Second Sight, Susceptible to the Divine, 
and Greater Malediction (when he enters 
a bargain, he is bound to the agreed terms 
unless its partner reneges first) instead 
of the usual template listed. Examples 
of such characters include the whelps of 
Infernal ghul, children conceived by cor-
rupt shaitan, or the grandchildren of Iblis 
himself. Repellent is a common Flaw, and 
some of the more powerful of these indi-
viduals have learned various Hedge Arts, 
including the Goetic Arts of Summoning 
and Commanding to enslave their pious 
jinni cousins.
Player character jinn created with a 
Might Score are susceptible to summon-
ing, dispelling and controlling spells that 
affect Vim rather than Mentem, regardless 
of Realm, although it should be noted that 
magi and mundane companions without 
Might can be equally affected by Corpus 
and Mentem magic that penetrates their 
Magic Resistance, if any.
Virtues and Flaws
This section includes several Virtues 
and Flaws first detailed in Realms of Power: 
Faerie that are appropriate for Faerie jinn 
and characters with strong jinni heritage 
New and Modified Virtues
These virtues are appropriate for Fa-
erie jinn characters.
External Vis
Minor or Major Virtue, Supernatural
The faerie’s spiritual essence (anchor) 
resides in one of the props traditional for 
its role, and this can be carried far from the 
faerie’s body without the faerie suffering 
ill effects. There is an Arcane Connection 
between the object containing the faerie’s 
spiritual essence and the faerie’s body. If 
this connection is broken, or the object is 
destroyed, the faerie’s distant body disin-
tegrates, but the essence can construct a 
new body, given sufficient time. If the vis 
in the prop is used, the faerie is perma-
nently destroyed.
When selected as a Major Virtue, the 
prop provides its bearer with any one 
Minor Virtue, selected at creation. This 
provides the faerie with a little additional 
power, but its main advantage is that hu-
mans who discover the object are far more 
likely to treasure it, and keep it safe. This 
provides the faerie with time to form a new 
physical body and reclaim his object.
As an example, a faerie warrior with a 
Might of 20 uses his sword as his spiritual 
anchor. A character that defeats the war-
rior finds that the sword contains 4 pawns 
of vis, but also finds that the sword has no 
Encumbrance and grants a human wielder 
a +2 bonus on the Single Weapon Ability. 
The bonus comes from the faerie’s Grant 
Puissance power. If the human keeps the 
weapon, then eventually the faerie can 
generate a fresh body, and seek out the 
wielder and challenge him to a duel.
Faerie Sight
Minor Virtue, Supernatural
This Virtue, which works constantly at 
no cost to the faerie, is used in conjunc-
tion with the Awareness Pretense. It allows 
faeries to:
• Tell mundane things from glamorous 
ones. (automatic success: no roll is 
required)
• See the borders of glamour, so that 
they know which faerie props and ter-
ritories belong to (automatic success: 
no is roll required)
• See Arcane Connections, so that they 
know which objects belong to a human 
(automatic success) and which human 
(if human and object can be observed, 
automatic success.)
• Read each other’s glamour. Faerie Lore 
is a body of knowledge that humans 
learn through experience, so very few 
faeries have it. (Ease Factor = Might of 
other faerie/5). Faeries use this ability 
to read each other’s glamour to guide 
their interactions, instead of using Fa-
erie Lore.
• See mundane things hidden by glam-
our (Ease Factor = 3 + (Might of Faerie 
causing the glamour – Might of the 
faerie attempting to see through the 
glamour)/5)
Faerie Speech
Minor Virtue, Supernatural
Many faeries have a Pretense called 
Faerie Speech that they use instead of 
acquiring human languages. Faeries seem 
to know the same languages as whomever 
they are talking to. If speaking to a group 
that has demonstrated mixed linguistic 
skills, the faerie may select which lan-
guage to speak.
This effect occurs whenever the faerie 
speaks and costs no Might. It is not magi-
cally resisted, because the effect only al-
ters the behavior of the faerie. If the faerie 
has not heard a person from its audience 
speak, it may only use whichever language 
it last used with humans. Once its audi-
ence speaks the faerie may then converse 
in the correct language for its audience.
Faerie Speech is frequently given to 
characters designed as NPCs. Characters 
designed for possible use by players have 
this Virtue more rarely, to free up a Virtue 
slot, but it is still appropriate for a wide 
variety of faeries.
Reputation as Confidence
Minor Virtue, Supernatural
Some faeries are forced, by their glam-
our, to live up to their Reputations. These 
faeries don’t have true Confidence, but 
pretend to have it to such a skilled degree 
that the distinction does not matter. A 
faerie with this Virtue gains a number of 
false Confidence points equal to its high-
est reputation, and may spend them, one 
at a time, on rolls that support any Reputa-
tion. The faerie regains these points when 
a human would regain Confidence.
Highly Cognizant faeries may be 
aware of the link between their Reputation 
and their need to uphold that Reputation 
with Confidence; other faeries with this 
Virtue are not.

The Cradle & The Crescent
New and Modified Flaws
These flaws are designed by Ferie jinn 
characters.
Intangible Flesh
Major Flaw, Supernatural
The character is immaterial, and can-
not physically influence the world. Char-
acters with this Flaw should consider the 
Eidolon and Loosely Material powers.
Traditional Ward
Minor Flaw, Supernatural
If a taboo is selected as a Minor Flaw 
then the faerie may not touch a thing pro-
tected by the ward with its glamour. The 
faerie is likely uncomfortable in the pres-
ence of the ward, but is not compelled 
to flee. The faerie cannot regenerate 
Might points in the presence of a tradi-
tional ward. If forced to touch the ward 
the glamour holding the faerie’s body to-
gether begins to break down: their body 
begins to flake away. Prolonged contact 
with the ward destroys the body of the 
faerie by unpicking the glamour holding 
its body together.
This may appear to humans as if the 
ward is burning the faerie. The damage to 
the faerie’s body can be simulated with the 
Heat and Corrosion rules found on page 
181 of ArM5. Assume that the object acts as 
a source of damage with an intensity of +6.
If a faerie receives an Incapacitating 
wound from an item that is a Traditional 
Ward, then in addition to the usual effects 
of Incapacitating wounds (ArM5, page 
178–179) the faerie cannot spend any 
further Might points. It can still activate 
powers with a zero cost. If the character 
has constant-effect powers with a non-
zero cost, they expire at the next sunrise 
or sunset and cannot be reactivated until 
the character is no longer Incapacitated. 
The character may heal at a human rate, 
or may remove the injury with an appro-
priate story event.
Monstrous Appearance
Major Flaw, General
Something about the character looks 
strange and frightening to others, giving 
the character a –6 penalty in all social situ-
ations where its appearance is a factor.
Sovereign Ward
Major Flaw, Supernatural
If a taboo is selected as a Major Flaw the 
faerie may not harm a person or thing that 
is defended by the ward. “Harm” is defined 
very broadly in the faerie’s glamor. A faerie 
that is vulnerable to religious symbols, for 
example, can not work around the symbol 
by putting mundane poison in the food 
of the wearer, or burning his house down 
around him. The person is completely safe 
from the faerie. The faerie must attempt 
to flee the ward, and its body is destroyed 
instantly by the ward’s touch.
Vulnerable to Folk Tradition 
(Islamic)
Minor Flaw, Hermetic or Supernatural
The being’s magic is susceptible to 
various folk-remedies for averting hostile 
spells. Any target that is aware that the 
creature has just used its magic may at-
tempt a folk ritual, such as making a sign 
against evil, spitting, and so forth. This 
grants the target or targets a Magic Resis-
tance equal to (5 x the target’s appropriate 
(Realm) Lore or Theology: Islam), or 0 if 
the target does have either of these Abili-
ties, against the being’s magic only. Fur-
thermore, someone with the appropriate 
(Realm) Lore or Theology: Islam may be 
able to devise a manner to break a lasting 
enchantment, such as plucking nine hairs 
from the tail of a cat and burning them in 
an enclosed room with a possessed victim; 
this typically requires an Intelligence + 
Ability roll against an Ease factor of (9 + 
the spell effect’s magnitude) or greater.

The religion of Zoroaster is a vener-
able one and his priests gave their names 
to the practitioners of magic itself. The 
followers of Zoroaster, also known as 
Mazdeans, worship the almighty God 
Ohrmazd. Mazdeans uphold the tenets of 
personal honesty and truthfulness. 
The Mazdean priesthood, called mo-
beds (in Greek, “magoi”), were once mas-
ters of the supernatural arts, commanding 
angels, spirits and elementals; predicting 
the future; transmuting the nature of mat-
ter; and performing great miracles. They 
are custodians of millennia of arcane lore 
and mystic knowledge. The mobeds were 
once a powerful tradition — their magic 
at its peak may even have come close to 
rivaling Hermetic Magic — but they are 
now greatly diminished.
This chapter details Zoroastrianism 
in Mythic Europe, its faith, practices and 
current concerns. It also describes the mo-
beds and their powers.
A Mythic 
History
Mazdeanism starts with the birth of 
its founder, the prophet Zoroaster (also 
known as Zarathustra), over six hundred 
years before the birth of Christ. Zoroaster 
was born to the virgin Dughdov and when 
he was born he laughed rather than cried. 
He was raised as a priest on the very edge 
of the Persian Empire.
After a period of meditating on the 
world in a sacred cave, Zoroaster was vis-
ited by God (called Ohrmazd), and from 
this came the Zoroastrian holy hymns, the 
Gathas. Zoroaster spent the next ten years 
preaching his new faith, traveling as far as 
the rising sun in the east, and throughout 
Persia. At age 42, Zoroaster converted the 
great Persian Emperor Vishtaspa after per-
forming a great number of miracles. Zo-
roaster was murdered in the city of Balkh 
by warriors of the Turanian Tribe while he 
prayed at a fire temple.
With imperial patronage the Mazdean 
faith, under the guidance of Zoroaster’s 
discipline Osthanes, quickly grew to be-
come the preeminent faith in Persia. The 
priests of Ohrmazd were known as mo-
beds, and they held the secrets of Zoro-
aster: how to understand the movements 
of the heavens, control spirits, and unlock 
the secrets of the natural world.
Under the Achaemenians and Parthi-
ans, the mobeds expanded their religion and 
practices into the west, and many great phi-
losophers from the Hellenic world traveled 
to learn the secrets of the Zoroastrians. 
A downturn for the faith came with 
the invasion of Persia by Alexander the 
Great. Temples, sanctuaries, and icons of 
the Mazdeans were plundered and de-
stroyed. The priests who defended their 
holy places were slaughtered; their scrip-
tures were burned. The Seleucid period 
Chapter Five
Mythic Zoroastrianism

The Cradle & The Crescent
that followed this time was one of despair 
for the Mazdean faithful. Persecuted, they 
saw their temples turned over to false 
gods, devils, and magical spirits. Their 
holy teachings were dispersed throughout 
the world for the impious and unbelievers 
to read and use.
The 
Zoroastrians 
regained 
their 
strength under the Sasanids, and came into 
conflict with the powerful Roman Empire 
and the Mercurian priests. During this pe-
riod, the Mazdeans and their priesthood 
were in furious conflict in the western 
provinces with the Mercurians of the Ro-
man Empire. Mobeds marched with Persian 
armies in Syria and Palestine, calling down 
angels and spirits, and giving their generals 
prophecies and visions of the future. These 
conflicts, however, were peripheral to the 
true struggle of the mobeds, which was 
principally a war against the followers of 
Ahriman, the Mazdean Devil.
Zoroastrians under Islam
The rise of Islam in early seventh cen-
tury spelled the end of the Zoroastrian 
dominance of Persia. Large numbers of 
Mazdeans converted to Islam after the de-
feat of the Sasanid Empire by the Islamic 
armies. This conquest is known among 
Mazdeans as “the ruin and devastation that 
came from the Arabs.”
For the Muslim overlords of Persia, 
Ohrmazd is one and the same as the God 
of Abraham; the Zoroastrian scriptures 
are in the same category as the Torah and 
the Gospel, and Mazdeans are considered 
“people of the book” (dhimmis). Zoroaster 
himself is thought of as a prophet. Despite 
this, a large body of laws has been insti-
tuted to enforce the social and legal infe-
riority of the dhimmi in the community. 
Zoroastrians particularly are (unofficially) 
discriminated against, called gabars (“infi-
dels”) and accused of fire and devil wor-
ship. Over the years many Zoroastrians 
have converted to Islam.
Most Zoroastrians who have not con-
verted have moved to remote and poor ar-
eas of south central Iran. Increasingly they 
are migrating further east to unknown 
lands. Despite this, Arabic has not dis-
placed the local language, and the Iranians 
maintain distinctly Persian cultural prac-
tices. The ancient glories of the Achae-
menian era, and the heroes who antedated 
the first Persian Empire, were preserved 
in countless tales, poems and stories. The 
Persian national epic Shahnameh, written by 
the poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is 
still widely read and recited in the 13th 
century, and details the mythological and 
historical past of pre-Islamic Persia, in-
cluding a history of Zoroastrianism.
The Mazdean Church
For much of the history of Mazdean-
ism, there existed a religious institution, 
composed of hierarchies of priests sup-
ported by the emperor. It was not until 
the high priests Tanser and Kartir under 
the Sasanids that there existed a formal 
Mazdean Church with an explicit hierar-
chy under the direct theological and spiri-
tual rule of the high priests.
The mobeds that ran the Mazdean 
Church also engaged in the suppression 
of rival “false” faiths that were prevalent 
in the empire, including Christianity, 
Manichaeism, Judaism, and other exotic 
faiths from the lands to the east. This 
practice continued until the end of the 
Sasanid dynasty.
The Mazdean Church was as thor-
oughly destroyed as the empire that sup-
ported it, although the institution of the 
priesthood survived. The priesthood is he-
reditary, rather than open to any who wish 
to become priests.
The remaining institution is colle-
giate in nature, with no single prelate to 
firmly resolve doctrinal disputes. As the 
Mazdeans are so few, so dispersed, and 
mostly persecuted, there are few theologi-
cal or doctrinal disputes of significance.
Mazdean Faith
Humata, hukhta, huvarshta 
(“Good thoughts, good words, 
   good deeds”)
	
	
— Mazdean saying
Mazdeans worship a single, all-power-
ful creator called Ohrmazd (“Wise Lord,” 
Ahura Mazda), who is opposed by Ahri-
man (“Destructive Spirit,” Angra Mainyu). 
Ohrmazd is the source of all creation and 
all good things that exist, and is transcen-
dent. Ahriman is the embodiment of every 
evil thing and concept.
Zoroaster preached a very high stan-
dard of personal morality that binds the 
laity and priesthood alike; actions taken 
in this life form the basis for reward or 
punishment in the next. Collectively, the 
A Note on Historical Accuracy
Zoroastrianism is one of the least 
well-known world religions; translations 
of its ancient texts are contradictory and 
their interpretations open to debate. 
Textual and archaeological evidence is 
scant, and there is little consensus among 
historians and theologians on many ele-
ments of their history or beliefs.
Zoroastrianism is also a living faith, 
undergoing internal debates about its 
own origins. The history of Zoroaster, 
the religion he founded and the na-
tions that adopted that faith as their 
state religion is open to debate and in-
terpretation. This chapter seeks to be 
respectful to this venerable living faith 
and its adherents. This is also a gam-
ing resource, so the most “mythic” of 
the various legends, histories and in-
terpretations are more often than not 
used as authoritative.
A Note on Names
Zoroastrian names have at least 
four differing versions: the old Avestan, 
Middle Persian, Parsi (the Persian spo-
ken in the 13th century), and Latinized 
names. This chapter uses the Avestan 
names more often than not, but the 
Parsi names are given in parentheses 
where appropriate. Some figures, such 
as Zoroaster, have their Latinized names 
only. “Zoroastrian” is used interchange-
ably with “Mazdean”.

The Cradle & The Crescent
actions of the faithful can bring about cos-
mic changes: the triumph of good over 
evil. Zoroaster’s teachings stress personal 
honesty and harmony with society.
The material universe is God’s good 
creation, and all unpleasant aspects of it, 
such as plagues, cold and drought, are 
products of Ahriman. Because there is a 
danger of physical corruption in the world, 
elaborate steps are taken with rituals and 
practices designed to maintain purity. 
These rites purify the body and the soul. 
It is in the material world that humanity 
makes its choices for right or for wrong. 
There is no rejection of the material world 
as being a source of sin or evil in itself. 
The world is to be enjoyed, although in 
moderation; asceticism has no place in the 
Zoroastrian faith.
Ohrmazd
My sixth name is Understanding; my 
seventh is Intelligent One; my eighth 
name is Knowledge; my ninth is Endowed 
With Knowledge; my twentieth is Mazda 
[Wisdom]. I am the Wise One; my name is 
the Wisest of the Wise.
	
	
— Yasht 1.7-1.15
Ohrmazd is the supreme creator of 
the world and all the good it contains. 
The Wise Lord is self-created, omniscient, 
omnipresent, holy, invisible, and beyond 
human comprehension. He is neither be-
gotten nor is anyone his equal. As creator 
of the earthly and celestial realms, he is 
the dispenser of every material good and 
spiritual blessing. 
Ohrmazd revealed to Zoroaster per-
sonally the mysteries of creation, the reali-
ty of life and death, and the unseen spiritu-
al powers that dwell invisibly throughout 
the world. To know Ohrmazd is to live 
in accordance with his divine will, to of-
fer him praise and worship, to please him 
in purity of thought, word and deed, and 
to further his cause by joining his forces 
against evil.
In Ars Magica, Ohrmazd is the God of 
the Divine Realm, the single all-powerful 
creator and sustainer. He resides beyond 
the Divine Realm, and is the same creator 
worshiped by all other monotheistic faiths, 
such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. 
His worshipers benefit from the Domin-
ion, and those with a personal relationship 
with him have True Faith.
Mazdean Divine Beings
There are a multitude of divine be-
ings in the Mazdean celestial hierarchy. 
Most of the angels and even the Ame-
shaspand (Amesha Spentas) spend a great 
deal of time both in the celestial Divine 
Realm and the material world. Ameshas-
pand, yazdan and Mazdean angels possess 
the same traits as the angels described in 
Realms of Power: The Divine, Chapter Two.
Ameshaspand
These are seven personifications of 
aspects of Ohrmazd, called Ameshaspand 
(“Holy Immortals”), who represent the 
highest principles of goodness. The Ame-
shaspand care for and protect creation. 
Each is a pathway to reaching Ohrmazd 
and personifies ideal Zoroastrian qualities.
According to Mazdean teachings, the 
Ameshaspand are part of Ohrmazd’s na-
ture. In Ars Magica, however, they are ex-
tremely powerful angels representing sev-
en aspects of God; they only act according 
to the direct will of the Wise Lord and 
accordingly their every act is miraculous. 
They are not, however, of the same nature 
as God. All Ameshaspand, in addition to 
their other Choirs, are also Archangels.
Vohu Manah (Bahman): The preeminent 
celestial being next to Ohrmazd, 
Vohu Manah (“Good Mind”) embod-
ies wisdom. He was the Wise Lord’s 
first creation and he guards the ani-
mal kingdom in the material world. 
He presides over good thoughts and 
wisdom, and commands divine spirits 
Story Seed: The Accursed Turanians
The Turanians were a tribe originat-
ing from around the Ural Mountains 
north of the Oxus River. Once consid-
ered a holy tribe, the Turanians were led 
astray by powerful diabolical forces and 
waged war against the pious Iranians. 
Zoroaster’s murderer, a Turanian soldier 
called Bratarvakhsh, was granted un-
told infernal powers and, using sorcery, 
raised a massive fortress called the For-
tress Arvandasp.
The Turanians were assimilated by 
the Turks during the seventh century; 
their diabolical elements were utterly 
destroyed. Infernal artifacts belonging 
to the Turanians, including the sword 
that killed Zoroaster, may still lie hidden 
in the lands north of the Oxus River.
Story Seed: The Demon-Blooded  
Paladins of Manochir
The paladins of Manochir roamed 
Persia before its conquest by Alexan-
der the Great. Legends say that the 
greatest paladin of the age fathered a 
white-haired child, a sign of demon 
blood. The descendents of the demon-
blooded son were mighty warriors, 
nearly unstoppable. 
When the Persian Empire was 
conquered, the Order of Manochir 
was disbanded by Alexander. He or-
dered that their great arms and armor, 
including a mace and a belt, be bur-
ied in secret in the desert. Alexander 
also tried to exterminate the demon-
blooded lineage. Rumors from those of 
Alexander’s troops who carried out his 
commands say that the mace could kill 
an elephant with a single blow, while 
whoever wore the belt was impervi-
ous to harm. A cache of these paladins’ 
awesome weapons would be a valuable 
discovery, as long as they are not infer-
nally tainted.

that encourage such things. Those 
who marry and raise a family are more 
blessed by Vohu Manah than those 
who choose an ascetic life. Vohu Ma-
nah also appeared to Zoroaster and 
led him to Ohrmazd. 
Asha (Asavahisht): As embodiment of 
divine and moral law, Asha (“Best 
Righteousness”) leads the path of 
the pure to Ohrmazd. The entire 
celestial realm lives according to the 
principles that Asha embodies, while 
the material world gravitates towards 
him. Asha encourages saintly behav-
ior, nobility of character, and truth. 
Asha guards the material fire, and 
thus embodies the highest value of 
the Mazdean faith.
Khshathra Vairya (Shahrevar): This Ame-
shaspand embodies the realization of 
heaven on earth, the “Desirable King-
dom”. Khshathra guards the sky, pro-
tects warriors, and presides over metal, 
which is his symbol. The riches of the 
world — gems, gold, and silver — be-
long to Khshathra. 
Spenta Armaiti (Spendarmad): A feminine 
Ameshaspand, Spenta Armaiti (“Holy 
Devotion”) is believed to be the 
daughter of Ohrmazd. She personifies 
devotion, piety, religious harmony, 
and faith. Particularly pious Mazdeans 
venerate Spenta Armaiti very highly 
(in this way, she is held in similar re-
gard to the Blessed Virgin Mary), as 
she enlightens the mind and purifies 
the heart. Zoroaster in particularly 
loved Spenta Armaiti above all other 
Ameshaspand. She governs the earth, 
granting bountifulness to the Wise 
Lord’s creations.
Haurvatat (Hordad): The personification 
of health, Haurvatat (“Wholeness”) is 
another female Ameshaspand. She gov-
erns water, and assists personal salvation 
and communication with Ohrmazd.
Ameratat (Amurdad): The personification of 
immortality and master of vegetation, 
Ameratat (“Life”) is inextricably linked 
with Haurvatat. The two form a spiri-
tual bond, promoting health, joy, com-
fort, and pleasure among the faithful.
Spenta Mainyu (Spenamino): Spenta Mainyu 
(“Good Spirit”) is the Ameshaspand of 
God Himself, the active Holy Spirit. 
From Spenta Mainyu issues life, light, 
and beauty. It is through Spenta 
Mainyu that God actively wages war 
upon Ahriman. He does so by creat-
ing good works and beautiful things, 
in opposition to the despair and evil 
created by Ahriman. Some Mazdeans 
believe Spenta Mainyu to be a part of 
the Godhead itself, a divine attribute. 
Like the other Ameshaspand however, 
Spenta Mainyu is actually a very holy 
and powerful angel (possibly the same 
being as Metatron).
The Yazdan
The yazdan (sing., yazad, “Adorable 
Ones”) are Zoroastrian angels and benev-
olent spirits. Figures such as Marduk and 
Mithras are yazdan (also called yazatas) of 
greater or lesser significance. They occupy 
The Mazdean “World Year”
According to Mazdean astrologers, 
there exists a “world year,” during which 
all heavenly bodies complete a full cycle 
of movement. The “world year” is a cycle 
of 12,000 years, divided into spans of 
three millennia. Each span saw the birth 
of either Zoroaster or one of the three 
Saviors of the World, and the broad pat-
tern of events was repeated. The year 
12,000 is believed to herald the victory 
of the Third Savior, the Saoshyant, who 
will complete the final defeat of evil.
Approximate dates are given in AD 
and BC. The table assumes a birth date 
for Zoroaster of 650 BC. There is no 
agreement, even in the Zoroastrian texts, 
of when precisely he was born.
0–3,000 Ohrmazd, with foreknowledge 
of need and means to destroy evil, 
brought his creation into being in a 
spiritual (menog) state. Ahriman, ris-
ing from the deep, perceived the cre-
ation, fashioned the evil spirits and 
attacked creation. Ohrmazd cast him 
down into hell by reciting the Ahun-
var prayer. (9619 BC–6619 BC)
3,000–6,000 Ahriman lay prostrate. 
Ohrmazd gave material form (ge-
tig) to creation, shaping the world 
in seven stages, with one primeval 
man, animal and plant. (6619 BC–
3619 BC)
6,000–8,969 Ahriman breaks into the 
material world, polluting it, and 
destroying the primeval creations. 
From their seed grew all existing 
plants, animals and men. The great 
king Yima reigned over mankind. 
Many events of Persian myth, leg-
end and epic took place. (3619 
BC–651 BC)
8,970 Birth of Zoroaster. (650 BC)
9,000 Beginning of Zoroaster’s Millen-
nium. Zoroaster receives his rev-
elation and begins his proselytizing. 
(620 BC)
9,001–9,969 Time of goodness, followed 
by slow decline. (607 BC–349 AD)
9,970 Birth of first World Saviour, Ukh-
shyat-ereta. (350 AD)
10,000 Beginning of Ukhshyat-ereta’s 
millennium. He led the forces of 
good and overcame evil. A new time 
of goodness was again followed by 
slow decline. (380 AD)
10,970 Birth of second World Saviour, 
Ukhshyat-nemah. (1350 AD)
11,000 Beginning of Ukhshyat-nemah’s 
millennium, where he will lead the 
forces of good to victory over evil, 
followed by period of slow decline. 
(1380 AD)
11,943 Birth of third World Saviour, 
Astvat-ereta, the True Saoshyant. 
(2323 AD)
11,973 He will bring the work of Frasho-
kereti to a conclusion with the res-
urrection of the dead, the Last Judg-
ment and the final conquest of evil. 
(2353 AD)
12,000 History will end. The Kingdom 
(Khshathra) of Ohrmazd will come 
on Earth and he will reign forever.

the third celestial rank, after God and the 
Ameshaspand.
There are 40 named yazdan, with the 
most important of the yazdan, such as 
Mithras, Haoma, Atar, or Vayu, receiving 
a hymn or Yasht of their own.
Many yazdan personify natural phe-
nomena or abstract ideas, such as the 
moon, stars, and winds, or blessings, obe-
dience, and peace. There are two distinct 
orders of yazdan, terrestrial (gaethya) and 
celestial (mainyava), although both have 
the same function: to grant various bless-
ings to those who invoke them with of-
ferings and sacrifices. Many yazdan are 
angels, but not all of them; rather, some 
are Divinely-aligned spirits.
Many of the faithful and their com-
munities have their own yazdan, who are 
venerated in the same way that Christians 
venerate saints. Yazdan can be invoked 
like a saint (see Realms of Power: The Divine, 
page 87), although they cannot be threat-
ened. To invoke a yazata, the invoker 
must be ritually pure (having undergone 
the Nahn purification rite, see Rites and 
Practices, later). 
Frohar
The frohar (both singular and plu-
ral; fravashi) are the perfect divine spirits 
of every created thing. For humans, they 
are guardian angels, although everything, 
plant, animal, element, even other divine 
spirits, have a frohar — only demons and 
beings from other Realms do not have one. 
The title of frohar is granted by Mazdeans 
to angelic beings of several different types 
— the Choirs of the Potentates, Authori-
ties, and Angels. Frohar guide the souls of 
the dead to the afterlife. They help the sun, 
moon, stars, and sky move, assist women 
to give birth, and bestow health upon the 
faithful. The longest Yasht of the Avesta (the 
Mazdean Bible) is devoted to the frohar.
Heaven
I came to a place and saw the souls of 
generous people, who walked adorned and 
were above all other souls in brightness. 
And Ohrmazd ever honored the souls of 
the generous, which were bright and tall 
and strong. And I said: ‘Happy are you, 
who are the soul of a generous person, 
exalted thus above all other souls.’ And it 
seemed to me praiseworthy.
	
— Arda Viraz Namag, Chapter 12
Reaching Heaven
Upon death, the human soul (urvan) 
remains with the body for three days. On 
the fourth, the soul is led by its frohar to 
the Chinvat Bridge (“the Bridge of the 
Separator”), which spans a great abyss. 
Heaven waits on the other side. At the 
bridge, each person’s soul is judged by 
Rashnu; also guarding the bridge are the 
yazdan Mithra and Sraosha. If the record 
of the person’s soul balances in favor of 
good thoughts, words and deeds, then the 
soul crosses without difficulty to heaven.
If the reverse is true, the bridge narrows 
to a knife’s edge, and the soul is sliced into 
ribbons as it falls into the abyss of hell.
Limbo
Mazdeans whose life’s words, thoughts, 
and deeds are equal parts good and bad 
are sent to hamestagna (hamestakan, “limbo”). 
Here the soul experiences no torment or 
torture, only discomfort.
Resurrection and Judgement
The blessed souls in heaven wait for 
the birth and triumph of the final and 
true Saoshyant (“World Savior”). At his 
appearance, all the dead, righteous and 
damned, will rise from on the spot where 
they died; their bodies will be surren-
dered from the seas and ground, their 
bones reformed from the earth, hair 
from plants, blood from water, and life 
from fire.
They will gather for the final judg-
ment. The wicked will be condemned to 
three days in hell; the pure will receive 
three days in heaven. After three days, 
all shall be purified, good and evil alike, 
by walking through molten metal. Ev-
ery soul will speak the ancient tongue 
of Avestan and worship Ohrmazd, and 
life will be restored to its perfect, pri-
mal state. This great army will then 
fight all of Ahriman’s demons in the fi-
nal Armageddon, leading to the triumph 
of Ohrmazd. His victory will herald an 
eternity of bliss.
Saints and Relics
The Zoroastrian faith does not have 
a special category of people considered 
“saints.” They do, however, have a pre-
ponderance of holy men and women 
— great kings, priests, warriors, and so 
on — who are venerated and invoked in 
prayers. The faithful prefer to call upon 
the aid of the yazdan, Ameshaspand, and 
angels. Similarly, the Mazdeans do not 
venerate relics, although there are a great 
many sacred and holy objects. These ob-
jects — including statues and inscriptions 
on walls — are imbued with Faith scores, 
and some may have other divine powers.
The Staff of Yoisht Frayana
Yoisht Frayana was a descendent 
of the Turanian apostle of Zoroaster, 
and defeated the sorcerer Akhtya in a 
battle of wits. Akhtya had terrorized 
the Mazdean priests for years, killing 
them after they failed to answer his 
riddles. Frayana successfully answered 
each of Akhtya’s 99 questions with the 
help of the Yazdan, and cast the sor-
cerer into hell.
The Staff of Yoisht Frayana is a pow-
erful Mazdean relic, with a Faith score 
of 5. It has the Acknowledgement of 
Evil, Celestial Immunity, Expel Demons 
and Grant Serenity powers (see Realms of 
Power: The Divine, page 88).

The Cradle & The Crescent
Fire
Fire is the central symbol of the 
Mazdean faith and is the visible sign of 
Ohrmazd’s divine presence. As the sym-
bol of truth (asha), fire is highly venerated 
by Mazdeans. All sacred fires, whether for 
temple or personal use, must be kept con-
stantly burning. Extinguishing a sacred fire 
is a grave sin, as is polluting it by dropping 
unclean objects into it. Only clean, dry 
wood can be used for a sacred fire, prefer-
ably sandalwood, aloe, or benzoin. 
The typical Zoroastrian sanctu-
ary is a fire temple, an agiari (literally, a 
“fire place”). It is a square enclosed cha-
pel with grillwork and vents to let the 
fire’s smoke out. The fire rests in an iron 
urn on a stone dais; the urn is typically 
filled with sand or ash on which the fire 
burns continuously. It is maintained by 
the priests of the temple, who must add 
wood and say the appropriate prayers 
five times daily.
Devout Mazdeans visit fire temples on 
a daily basis, while the less observant only 
attend on sacred days of the month. In 13th 
century Mythic Europe, with the Zoroastri-
an faithful pushed to the edge of the Mus-
lim world, there are only a few temples with 
fires burning full-time. In their place, many 
Zoroastrians keep small oil lamps or wood 
fires burning in the home. This type of fire 
is the simplest and is called atesh dadgah (“fire 
of the appointed place”). If this fire is used 
for cooking, then cooking pots must not be 
more than two-thirds full, to avoid the con-
tents boiling over and polluting the fire. 
There are two grades of sanctified or 
“royal” fire above the atesh dadgah: the atesh 
adaran (“fire of fires”) and the atesh Behram (or 
atesh Varahran, “fire of the guardian Varah-
ran”). The atesh adaran is the union of four 
ceremonially ignited fires. The highest 
grade of fire, atesh Behram, requires combin-
ing fires from 16 different sources and takes 
considerable time to perform the ceremonial 
lighting.
Mazdean Dominions
Mazdeans enjoy the same Dominion as 
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, with the 
Dominion aura extending from the sacred 
flame at the fire temple or from a sacred 
fire in the home. The size and sacredness 
of the fire increases the Dominion.
The Dominion aura’s rating decreases 
as the distance from the sacred fire increas-
es, so that the aura ratings are the same 
in the community as laid out in Chapter 
One, Realms of Power: The Divine. Thus, the 
highest Dominion Aura is near the sacred 
fire, decreasing to the borders of the fire 
temple (or building), with the lower rating 
throughout the faithful community (the 
village or town and their fields).
In areas where Mazdeans live side by 
side with other Divine faiths (Islam for ex-
ample), their Dominion aura is likely to be 
in Schism.
Atesh Dadgah: Increase Dominion Aura 
by +1 (max rating 3)
Atesh Adaran: Increase Dominion Aura by 
+3 (max rating 5)
Atesh Behram: Increase Dominion Aura 
by +6 (max rating 10)
Ahriman
Thus spoke the Evil One: ‘Nei-
ther our thoughts nor teachings nor 
wills, neither our choices nor words 
nor acts, not our inner selves nor our 
souls agree.’
		
— Yasna, Verse 45
Ahriman is the Zoroastrian Devil. He 
personifies the Lie (Druj), and is leader of 
the demonic hordes; he embodies every 
negative and evil thing and concept in the 
universe. Ahriman pollutes and corrupts 
the bodies and minds of humans, inflicting 
upon them disease, deformities and decay, 
as well as moral turpitude, lies, malicious 
thoughts, and false teachings. For every 
good creation of Ohrmazd, Ahriman made 
an evil one. Ahriman is the same being as 
the Christian, Muslim and Jewish Devil.
Like the Devil in Christian tradition, Ah-
riman was not of evil substance, but made a

87
The Cradle & The Crescent
conscious decision to deny God and be evil. 
Because he is not omniscient or omnipo-
tent, Ahriman cannot foresee his own final 
defeat, and because he has no forethought, 
he cannot know of things to come.
Mazdean Devils
The daevas and all Mazdean demons 
have the same traits as those in Chapter 
Four of Realms of Power: The Infernal. The 
daevas are exceptionally powerful de-
mons, with high Infernal Might scores 
and ranks.
The Daevas
Created by Ahriman in mockery of the 
Ameshaspand, the daevas are the unholy 
arch-demons of evil who oppose and con-
trast with the Holy Immortals. Together, 
they are known as the Druj, “the Lie”. All 
that is foul and corrupt, vile and harmful 
is personified by a daeva. Not merely to 
do with nature or physical corruption, the 
daevas are also responsible for the darker 
emotions such as hate and envy.
Aka Manah is Ahriman’s chief lieuten-
ant and opposes Vohu Manah. He perverts 
the minds of humans with evil thoughts, 
and blunts their intelligence and reason. 
His chief role is to create discord and 
spiritual disruption. Mazdeans believe 
that the reason children cry when they 
are born is because Aka Manah frightens 
them with ghastly visions of suffering. 
Indra drives humans away from virtuous 
deeds and thoughts, opposing Asha. Saura 
also delights when the faithful discard the 
symbols of purity and goodness, although 
his main activity is to encourage tyranny 
and anarchy; Saura opposes Khshathra. 
Naonghaithya opposes Spenta Armaiti, 
and attacks the faith and devotion inside 
people’s souls, encourages disobedience, 
and opposes faithfulness. Taurvi and 
Zairich oppose Haurvatat and Amerertat 
respectively, causing imperfections and 
mortality in plants and animals, spreading 
diseases and deformity, creating poison-
ous plants and animals, and spoiling food 
with decay.
Demons
There are 45 named demons in the 
Mazdean scriptures, all of whom oppose 
the yazdan and Ohrmazd. The demons 
assault the faithful, plot, seduce and de-
stroy, kill and torment, and seek at every 
moment to cause evil. Zoroastrian de-
mons share the characteristics of demons 
as described in Chapter 4 of Realms of 
Power: The Infernal. 
Hell
And I saw the blackest hell, danger-
ous, fearful, terrible, holding much pain, 
full of evil, foul-smelling. Then I thought 
that it seemed like a pit, to whose bottom 
a thousand spears would not reach; and 
if all the firewood which is in the world 
were placed on the fire in the most evil-
smelling, darkest hell, it would never give 
out fragrance. Again, as close as eye to 
ear, and as many as the hairs on a horse’s 
mane, so close and many in number are 
the souls of the wicked therein. Yet they 
see not, and hear no sound from one an-
other. Each one thinks: ‘I am alone.’ And 
they suffer gloom and darkness and stench 
and fearfulness and torment and punish-
ment of diverse kinds …
	
— Arda Viraz Namag, Chapter 55
The Mazdean Hell is the abode of all 
evil rulers, evil-doers, evil-speakers, evil-
thinkers, and those of evil conscience. 
Those damned souls condemned to go to 
Hell are surrounded by demons and evil 
spirits, doomed to suffer torments and 
deception for all eternity. Each type of 
sin attracts its own torments and punish-
ments. Those who commit mortal sins of 
the flesh, extinguish holy fires, destroy 
bridges, speak falsely, or give false wit-
ness are punished with bitter cold, blaz-
ing fire, and foul stenches. Those who 
deny the good religion are bitten and 
devoured by serpents. Women who are 
vain and falsely mourn have their heads 
cut off and their tongues torn out. People 
who do not keep themselves purified and 
clean, or who pollute lakes and rivers, are 
beaten by demons.
Each individual thus holds the key to 
his or her own destiny. By choosing to 
perform evil acts or think evil thoughts, an 
individual condemns himself to Hell.
Mazdean Heresies
Mazdeanism has had its share of he-
retical movements. In their time, the 
heresies were all severely persecuted and 
repressed by the Mazdean Church and 
imperial authorities. None survive into 
the 13th century. Nevertheless, the im-
pact of these heresies, and their relics and 
monuments, may still remain, lost and 
waiting to be found. Mazdean heresies 
including the Zurvanites, who believed 
that Ohrmazd had a father called Zurvan 
(Time), and that free will was an illusion, 
and the Mazdakites, who were ascetics, 
and practiced poverty.
Story Seed: A Heretical Revival
The Cult of Mithras was a Mazdean 
heresy that was popular in the west-
ern provinces of the Persian Empire, 
especially following the arrival of 
Hellenism after Alexander the Great. 
Although it was persecuted by the 
imperial Mazdean priesthood, it had 
a profound effect on Western mystic 
practices and beliefs. 
In a Mithraeum in Mythic Europe, a 
Hermetic magus of the Cult of Mithras, 
perhaps a player’s character, discovers a 
cache of scrolls explaining the historical 
link between Mazdeanism and Mithra-
ism, as well as suggesting the secret lo-
cation of the birthplace of Mithras, in 
deepest Persia. 
What would happen if a Hermetic 
Mithraist discovers the still-living reli-
gion of Ohrmazd, and how will they re-
act upon learning the Mazdeans believe 
Mithras to be a divine spirit?

The Cradle & The Crescent
Rites and 
Practices
Man’s first duty on earth is to profess 
the religion and to practice and worship 
according to it; not to turn from it, but to 
have belief in the Good Religion of the 
Mazda-worshipers ever in mind; to dis-
tinguish profit from loss, sin from virtue, 
goodness from badness, light from dark-
ness, Mazda-worship from daeva-worship.
	
        — The Teachings of the Magi
A great number of ritual practices are 
performed as part of the Mazdean faith. 
For pious Mazdeans, their faith is not a 
set of doctrines or a system of belief, but 
rather a faith that is lived through its 
prescribed rites and sets of behavior that 
shape their lives and endow them with 
meaning and purpose. 
Like all faiths, the level of observance 
of the rites varies from person to person. 
Most Mazdeans observe the major rituals 
and ceremonies of their faith, recite the 
main prayers and genuinely believe in the 
tenets of Mazdeanism.
Like the sacraments and other reli-
gious rites of other Divine religions, prop-
erly performed prayers, ceremonies and 
rituals have a real spiritual and mystical ef-
fect. In Ars Magica, purification rituals re-
ally do spiritually cleanse the person who 
performs them, burial rites allow a person’s 
soul to reach the afterlife, and prayers re-
ally do result in miracles.
Prayers
The recitation of prayers is a major 
element of all Mazdean rites. There are 
hundreds of prayers recorded, although 
three have special prominence and are 
used most frequently. Their potency and 
sacredness is so great that they are re-
corded in every Zoroastrian library and 
form a part of almost every ritual and re-
ligious ceremony. Their recitation is con-
sidered one of the most effective prayers 
to Ohrmazd.
Ahuna Vairya: “Just as God is powerful, so 
is Zoroaster, because of His power of 
Asha. The gift of Vohuman is for the 
person who serves Ohrmazd. Any per-
son who helps the needy shall receive 
help from Ohrmazd.”
Ashem Vohu: “Righteousness is good, it is 
best. According to our wish it is, ac-
cording to our wish it shall be. Righ-
teousness belongs to Asha Vahista.”
Yenhe Hatam: “We worship those male 
and female beings whom Ohrmazd 
knows are best for worship according 
to righteousness.”
Videvdat
A major liturgical service of the mo-
beds, the Videvdat is performed in the 
fire temple by qualified priests. It takes 
place between midnight and dawn, with 
recitations from the Yasna, the Visparad, 
and the Videvdat (see Mazdean Scrip-
tures, later) to invoke divine spirits and 
ward off demons. Offerings are made to 
Ohrmazd and the Ameshaspand to coin-
cide with sunrise.
Purity Rites
The ritual link between purity and im-
purity symbolizes each Mazdean’s person-
al participation in the cosmic war against 
evil. The purification ritual practices and 
symbolic gestures of Mazdeanism symbol-
ize this struggle on a daily basis.
There are three categories of purifi-
cation rituals. The most important is the 
Bareshnum, which is undertaken by each 
Mazdean at least once in their life. The 
second comprises three rituals observed 
on specific occasions: Padyab, Nahn and 
Riman. The final type of ritual includes 
various ritual actions to ensure continuous 
purification, both personal and communal.
All of the purification rituals (exclud-
ing padyab and the daily rituals) drive 
away any possessing spirit, infernal or 
otherwise and cancel any non-permanent, 
non-Divine supernatural effects.
Bareshnum
This rite is required for all candidates 
for the priesthood, but its function is to re-
gain and maintain ritual purity. It also aids 
the soul’s journey to heaven, and is often 
performed when someone is about to die.
The ritual itself consists of three cer-
emonial baths performed with the aid of 
two priests at a fire temple over a ten-day 
period; a total of 18 applications of con-
secrated bull urine (nirangdin), sand, and 
water; the presence of a dog 13 times; and 
the recitation of various prayers. The can-
didate similarly meditates, prays, and ob-
serves ritual acts during the ten days.
The ritual does not work if any of the 
ingredients used are contaminated during 
the ritual’s performance, if any impurity 
enters the fire temple, it rains during the 
ceremony, or if the candidate dies before 
the end of the ceremony.
In addition to the purifying effect de-
scribed earlier, the subject of this ritual also 
gains a Faith Point, although he only gains 
it once (the first time), even if the rite is 
performed again on subsequent occasions.
Padyab
A simple ablution ritual performed 
several times a day: in the morning after 
rising, after answering calls of nature, 
before taking meals, and before saying 
prayers. The rite consists of a short prayer 
formula, the washing of the face and ex-
posed parts of the body (generally hands 
and feet), and the untying and re-tying of 
the sacred cord.
Nahn
A sacred bath purification requiring 
the services of a mobed, it can be con-
ducted either at home or in a fire temple. 
It is only performed during the day, and 
The Sacred Cord
The sacred cord of the Mazdeans 
(called a kusti) is a long woven cord, 
tied three times around the waist. The 
cord is central to many of the rituals 
and symbols of the faith, representing 
the connection between heaven and 
earth. All practicing Mazdeans have 
a kusti.

The Cradle & The Crescent
is observed during the Navjote ceremony, 
marriage, forty days after childbirth, and 
on any one day during the Farvardegan 
holiday marking the end of the Mazdean 
year. The ceremony involves chewing a 
sacred pomegranate leaf, drinking a few 
drops of consecrated bull urine, recit-
ing of the Repentance Prayer, applying 
unconsecrated bull urine (gomes) over the 
body from the head down, performing the 
sacred bath, and dressing in a new set of 
clothes. A longer, more complex purifica-
tion ritual similar to this is administered to 
those who are particularly impure — this 
is called the Si-Shuy Nahn.
Riman
This purification ritual requires two 
attendants (one of whom must be a 
priest), and is only performed on those 
who have come into contact with corpses 
in the course of ministering to the dead. 
It involves chewing pomegranate leaves, 
drinking consecrated bull urine, and ritu-
ally washing. The two attendants must 
also purify themselves. If the subject is 
a woman, she performs the ritual behind 
a partition.
Daily Rites
When a Mazdean comes into contact 
with substances considered impure, he or 
she is rendered ritually impure. Impure 
substances include hair, skin, nails, blood, 
saliva, urine, feces, semen, and menstrual 
blood when they leave or are separated 
from the body. Carrion, rotting flesh, or 
plant matter, and foul-smelling air are also 
considered impure. There are thus specific 
rituals to be performed when cutting hair 
and nails, sneezing and yawning, urinating 
and excreting, as well as after sex (the act 
of which is not impure or sinful in itself, 
although the resulting excretions are). 
There are purification acts for purifying 
utensils, tools, furniture, and rooms.
The Yasna
The Yasna (“sacrifice”) is the most im-
portant ritual for Mazdeans, and is per-
formed daily each morning by priests in the 
fire temple. Performing the Yasna is consid-
ered a key weapon in the struggle against 
evil. This ritual is a priestly function and 
requires no witnesses or lay participants.
It takes about two and a half hours, 
and is performed by two priests in a spe-
cial area in the fire temple called the pawi. 
The Yasna establishes a connection be-
tween the spiritual (menog) and material 
(getig) worlds, inviting the tangible pres-
ence of Ohrmazd and the Ameshaspand 
to the fire temple.
During the ceremony, Ohrmazd and 
his angels are reverently invoked, and the 
72 chapters of the Yasna are recited as the 
priests walk symbolically around the pawi. 
At the end of the ceremony, consecrated 
haoma is poured onto the floor as an of-
fering to the Wise Lord. The remaining 
libation and bread is consumed by the 
priests and other attending worshipers. 
This consumption mystically links the at-
tendants of the ceremony with the divine 
forces present.
Once the ritual is complete, the Do-
minion Aura around the holy fire increases 
by three points (but not beyond eight), 
decreasing by one point every five paces 
from the fire until returning to normal; this 
effect lasts for only an hour. The priests 
who perform the ritual and attendant wor-
shipers gain a Faith Point. Worshipers in 
a state of sin do not get this benefit, and 
if any of the priests are impure during the 
ritual, there is no benefit.
Birth, Initiation,  
Marriage, and Burial
There are four ceremonies that coin-
cide with significant times in a Mazdean’s 
life. There are prayers, purification rituals 
and devotions coinciding with birth, ini-
tiation of a child into the community, mar-
riage, and, finally, burial.
Birth
Before birth, at the fifth and seventh 
months, a sacred lamp is lit to ward off de-
mons that may seek to harm unborn babies. 
Forty days after the birth of the child, the 
mother is given a purifying bath (the Nahn). 
A child is taken to the fire temple on his or 
her first birthday and has ashes from the sa-
cred fire applied to his or her forehead.
The lamps lit in this ceremony in-
crease the Dominion aura in the room the 
lamp is in, by one point (up to a maximum 
rating of 3; there is no effect if there is no 
base Dominion aura, or if the Dominion is 
already at level 3 or higher).
Initiation
This ritual, called the Navjote, makes a 
child, aged 12 to 15, responsible for hon-
oring Mazdean religious observances. The 
child receives his or her sacred cord (kusti) 
and sacred white shirt (sedra), takes puri-
fying baths, and makes the declaration of 
the articles of faith (fravarane): “I profess 
myself a Mazdean, a follower of Zoro-
aster, opposing the demons, accepting the 
doctrine of Ahura, one who praises the 
beneficent immortals, who worships the 
beneficent immortals. I accredit all good 
things, those that are indeed the best, to 
Ohrmazd the good.”
A character who undergoes the Nav-
jote receives a Faith Point, which can be 
used as normal. It is lost if the character 
performs a significant sin. Additionally, 
the rites performed in this ceremony 
have the effect of rendering the child’s 
name unusable as a True Name for super-
natural activities, in the same way that 
baptism does.
Marriage
The ceremony of marriage is an im-
portant religious occasion, involving the 
bride and groom taking purifying baths, 
with the ceremony itself happening just 
after sunset. A procession of priests, offi-
cials, the bridegroom, and his family (and 
sometimes musicians) enters the bride’s 
home; the bridegroom stays outside, 
where his head is marked in red. After this, 
he enters and sits before the priest. The 
bride enters some time later and sits next 
to the bridegroom, with a cloth hanging 
between them. Prayers are said, vows are 
exchanged, and benedictions are made. A 
sacred fire and candle are present through-
out. At the end of the ceremony, there is 
typically a feast.
The marriage ceremony grants both 
bride and groom a Faith Point that may be 
used to strengthen their resolve in the face 
of adversity or temptation.

Holy Festivals
Although each day is holy, there are seven special holy 
festivals in the Zoroastrian calendar, dedicated to each 
Ameshaspand. Each festival goes for five days. The seventh 
festival, known as No Roz (“New Day”) is the greatest holy 
festival of the Mazdean calendar, prefiguring the final “New 
Day” of eternal bliss. Note that the festival dates, although 
associated with seasons, have drifted significantly from their 
original dates. The dates are given in Imperial (S) and An-

The Cradle & The Crescent
Burial
The ceremonies of death and burial 
are the most difficult, especially for those 
Mazdeans in Muslim lands, where they are 
forced to comply with local laws and cus-
toms. Traditionally, the corpse is ritually 
washed and dressed. A dog is presented, 
so it gazes at the corpse, both to ensure 
the person is really dead, and to ward off 
evil spirits (this ritual is called sagdid, “dog-
sight”). The Ahuna Vairya prayer is recited 
by priests, and then the body is taken to 
the funerary tower (dakhma, “Tower of Si-
lence”), a massive tower-like building ex-
posed to the sun and flesh-eating birds. 
The bones of the dead are left to dry, and 
then thrown into a deep well filled with 
lime and phosphorus.
The soul of a Mazdean buried accord-
ing to this way (or any Divine ritual) can 
never be affected by any form of magic. 
This puts it beyond the reach of Hermetic 
and other forms of magic.
The Mazdean Calendar
The Zoroastrian calendar has a year of 
twelve months with thirty days each, with 
an extra five days inserted after the eighth 
month in Persia, or at the end of the year 
elsewhere. There is no seven-day week 
for the followers of Zoroaster. Each day 
is dedicated to a divine being, to whom 
the faithful should dedicate their good 
actions and thoughts on that day. Each 
month is also dedicated to a divine being. 
Consequently, once a month, the day and 
month have the same name, which is the 
cause for special reverence. The ninth day 
of the month, sacred to fire, is favored in 
any month for visits to the fire temple, but 
especially so during the ninth month (also 
sacred to fire).
There has been periodic reform of 
the calendar to stabilize the months 
in relation to the seasons, but over the 
decades and centuries the dates have 
drifted to become out of sync with the 
seasons (with no leap year, the day drifts 
by one day ever four years). This has re-
sulted in different Mazdean communities 
using different calendars — the Shenshai 
(“Imperial”) and Fasli (“Ancient”) — so 
that they hold their holy days at differ-
ent times.
During the five days of the holy fes-
tivals, the Dominion Aura radiating from 
the fire temples takes on a nature abhor-
rent to the forces of Ahriman. Any crea-
ture with Infernal Might that seeks to 
enter the Aura is unable to do so if their 
Might Score is less than the Dominion 
Aura x10. Should they succeed in entering 
the Aura, they suffer an amount of dam-
age per hour equal to the Dominion Aura 
rating (which can be Soaked as normal). 
On the final day of each holy festival, the 
damage inflicted on Infernal beings can-
not be Soaked.
Haoma
Haoma (hom) is a sacred plant used 
to make an intoxicating drink. The 
drink is made by pounding the leaves 
and stems of the plant. The plant is 
so sacred that it has its own powerful 
yazata to protect and nurture it. When 
prepared according to sacred principles 
it increases health and fertility, and can 
even aid in the pursuit of immortality. 
Haoma is especially important for many 
Mazdean purification rituals, prayers, 
and invocations.
When used in alchemical and herbal 
potions and brews, haoma grants a +3 
bonus for effects that promote health 
or fertility and for effects that allow 
the consumer to see invisible, spiritual 
beings. When used in effects promot-
ing longevity, it grants the character a 
+5 bonus.
Consumed without mystical prepa-
ration, but properly fermented, haoma 
has mild hallucinogenic effects (tem-
porarily granting the Visions Flaw), in-
creases arousal, and increases strength 
(character gain a +1 bonus to acts of 
strength). The effects last between one 
and three hours.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Mazdean Scriptures
Zoroastrianism emphasizes its oral 
traditions and all priests learn the scrip-
tures by heart. The words of Zoroaster 
were written down over his lifetime to 
form the Avesta. There are many books 
making up the Avesta, many of which have 
been lost, destroyed or pillaged following 
the Muslim conquest of the Sasanid Em-
pire. While some fire temples may possess 
copies of parts — even large parts — the 
chief role of the priesthood is to act as 
living scriptures, memorizing every word 
and prayer.
Avesta
The Avesta contains the hymns, formu-
las, laws and stories of the Mazdean faith. 
There are two main parts to the Avesta. 
The Avesta is also written in multiple lan-
guages, Avestan and “Gathic,” a liturgical 
language for prayers. The Ability Dead 
Language: Avestan grants knowledge in 
both. There are translations into Parsi 
(and other languages, like Latin, Arabic, 
and Greek), although they are not con-
sidered holy.
The Yasna
The Yasna is the chief liturgy of the 
Mazdeans. “Yasna” literally means “sac-
rifice”, and includes confessions, rituals, 
prayers, exhortations, praise, and worship 
of Ohrmazd. The Yasna is formed from six 
Gathas (hymns), and has a total of 72 chap-
ters. Five of the six Gathas are considered 
to be the direct word of Zoroaster him-
self. The sixth was written by his disciples. 
(Summa, Theology: Zoroastrian, Quality 
4, Level 9.)
The Visparad
The shorter liturgy, the Visparad (“to 
all the lords”) is 23 chapters of invoca-
tions, praise, and hymns to Ohrmazd, the 
yazdan, and the other powerful divine be-
ings, and also includes the seasonal festi-
vals (gahambars). (Summa, Dominion Lore, 
Quality 3, Level 4.)
The Videvdat
The Videvdat (Vendidad, “law abjuring 
demons”) has 22 sections containing the 
religious, civil, criminal, and purification 
laws of Mazdeanism. It also details the 
life of Zoroaster and the origins of medi-
cine (medicine by knife, herbs, and sacred 
rites). (Summa, Theology: Zoroastrian, 
Quality 6, Level 6.)
The Khordeh Avesta
Often combined with the Yasht (see 
later), the Khordeh Avesta (“Little Avesta”) is 
for use by priests and lay folk in private 
devotion. It is a summary of the Avesta, 
containing prayers, invocations, and bless-
ings. (Tractatus, Theology: Zoroastrian, 
Quality 6)
The Yasht
The Yasht (“worship”) is a collection 
of 22 hymns and prayers invoking yazdan 
and angels. Each prayer invokes only a 
single being, such as Ohrmazd, each of 
the Ameshaspand, and the sun, moon, 
stars, Mithra, and Sroasha respectively. 
(Tractatus, Theology: Zoroastrian, Qual-
ity 6)
Mazdean 
Characters
Mazdean characters have access to 
unique Virtues, Flaws, and Abilities, re-
flecting their faith, culture and society.
Virtues and Abilities
Making a Mazdean character depends 
on the saga. Sagas set in predominately 
Muslim or Christian lands would see the 
Mazdean character take the Outsider Ma-
jor Flaw. In areas where Mazdeans are a 
sizeable minority, or even a majority, then 
the other Social Status Virtues and Flaws 
can also be taken.
There are Zoroastrian versions of 
the Theology and Civil and Canon Law 
Abilities. Additionally, some mobeds and 
Mazdeans may speak Avestan, their sacred 
religious language. Most Mazdeans speak 
Parsi (Persian) or the language of their 
area, such as Arabic.
A mobed character may take the Se-
nior Clergy Major Social Status Virtue 
(see The Church, Diocese Chapter), reflect-
ing the character’s status as a dastur (“senior 
priest”). This reflects the fact that your 
character is in charge of several subordi-
nate mobeds, and probably governs a large 
fire temple.
Mazdeans typically do not take Vir-
tues or Flaws that would make them a 
monk or nun. To Mazdeans, the world is 
a wonderful place to be lived in and en-
joyed. The fight against evil takes place in 
society, so being cloistered away and prac-
ticing an ascetic lifestyle of deprivation is 
not in keeping with their faith. There is 
also no tradition of wandering holy men 
or women in orthodox Mazdeanism (pre-
cluding analogs of Virtues or Flaws such as 
Mendicant Friar).
New Ability:  
Dead Language (Avestan)
Avestan is the holy liturgical language 
of the Zoroastrian Holy Scriptures, used 
by Zoroaster himself. No longer spoken or 
written outside of the fire temples, the lan-
guage is now used purely for sacred hymns 
and prayers. This ability allows your char-
acter to read and write texts in Avestan, 
and to understand the words of prayers 
spoken in Avestan. 
To write this language (written from 
right to left), your character must have a 
score of at least one in Artes Liberales. 
This Ability is generally only possessed 
by mobeds.
Specialties: Liturgies, scripture, oral 
tradition, alphabets, myths. (Academic)
New Virtue: Magian Lineage
Minor or Major, General
This Virtue makes the character a true 
blood descendent of the original Median 


--- Page ---

93
The Cradle & The Crescent
tribe of Magians, the original priestly 
caste of Persia. Many mobeds possess this 
Virtue, either Minor or Major, but is not 
a requisite.
Minor: Your character’s lineage is weak, al-
though he or she is still ethnically Ma-
gian, and gains a strong constitution 
due to his purity. The character gains a 
–1 bonus to Aging rolls and a +3 bonus 
to resist the effects of disease.
Major: In addition to the benefits of the 
Minor Virtue, your character has an 
affinity with the ancient prophetic and 
other mystical arts of your ancestors. 
The player must choose three Arcane 
or Supernatural Abilities which the 
character need not start play with, and 
which cannot be True Names. These 
Abilities are considered connected, 
so that whenever your character suc-
cessfully studies one of these Abilities 
(that is, gains at least one experience 
point from study), he or she gains an 
additional experience point in each of 
the other two.
New Virtue: Mazdean Priest
Minor, Social 
Your character is an ordained Mazdean 
priest, initiated as a mobed. This means 
that the character may carry out the vari-
ous rituals and ceremonies, such as the 
Yasna, Vivevdat, Navjote, marriage, burial, 
official prayers, purification rituals, light-
ing of sacred fires, and initiation of new 
priests. In Mazdean communities, your 
character is held in high regard and treat-
ed with great respect. The character wears 
pure white clothes and when performing 
ceremonies, covers his face with a white 
veil to protect the sacred flame from his 
breath and saliva.
As a mobed, your character resides 
in a community that likely has a fire 
temple. This means that your character 
has arduous and time-consuming reli-
gious and ceremonial duties. Most of 
your time is spent praying, performing 
ritual purification rites and tending to 
the sacred fire. If you are Wealthy, you 
have several ervads (junior priests) who 
perform many of the more arduous tasks. 
If you are Poor, it likely reflects the poor 
station of Mazdeans in the community 
in general, and you may also possess the 
Outsider Flaw.
Your character may take Academic 
Abilities at character generation. You 
must take the Minor Personality Flaw Vow 
(ArM5, page 60) to reflect your constant 
state of ritual purity, and dedication to 
your community. This Virtue is only avail-
able to male characters.
New Virtue:  
Knowledge of True Names
Minor or Major Supernatural 
Your character may start play knowing 
one or more True Names of supernatural 
beings. Any Mazdean character may take 
this Virtue, although it is only of use to 
those characters with supernatural abilities 
or powers. This Virtue reflects the deep 
and ancient occult knowledge possessed 
by the mobeds.
At the storyguide’s discretion, this vir-
tue may be made available to other char-
acters, such as sahirs, Hermetic theurgists, 
infernalists, or Holy Magi.
Minor: This virtue grants you 30 experi-
ence points to spend on True Names 
— each True Name costs 5 experience 
points to learn. Names with fewer 
than 5 experience points provide no 
benefit at all, but you can decide to 
partially learn a True Name by spend-
ing fewer than 5 experience points on 
it. Each True Name is recorded under 
Abilities as “True Name of (Being).” 
The character may know the True 
Names of beings from the Magic, Fa-
erie and Infernal realms. You may take 
this virtue more than once to gain ad-
ditional experience points to spend on 
True Names.
Major: The Major Virtue version of 
Knowledge of True Names is identi-
cal to the Minor version, also grant-
ing 30 experience points, except that 
you may also know the True Names 
of angels and other divine beings. 
Storyguides and troupes should con-
sider this Virtue carefully before al-
lowing it.
The Mobeds: 
Princes of Magic
Without a doubt magic arose in Per-
sia, with Zoroaster. On this our authori-
ties are agreed …
	
— Pliny, Natural History, 30.2.3
The priests of Ohrmazd are the mo-
beds, whose lineage can be traced back 
to the Median tribe and Zoroaster him-
self. The mobeds are a holy tradition, 
with Initiations that grant them unique 
holy powers.
In centuries past, the mobeds were sag-
es who possessed great occult knowledge. 
In addition to their holy powers, they had 
mastered the forces of magic, astrology, 
alchemy, and theurgy. That knowledge is 
largely lost in the 13th century, and mo-
beds are now almost exclusively practitio-
ners of holy powers.
The Mazdean priesthood is heredi-
tary: only sons of a mobed or the male de-
scendents of a priestly family can be con-
sidered for priestly office. Needless to say, 
mobeds are not celibate and may marry.
There are several ranks, and initia-
tions that must be performed to achieve 
each rank. The lowest rank of Mazdean 
priest is that of ervad. An ervad may per-
form ordinary services, but none of the 
important rituals. The ceremony of mar-
tab initiates a priest to the rank of mobed, 
a fully qualified priest, able to perform all 
services and rituals. The highest remain-
ing rank is that of dastur, the head of a 
group of priests of an area or particular 
fire temple. Higher levels of the priest-
hood have been lost to time.
Zoroastrian Magi
Realms of Power: The Divine gives 
rules for Zoroastrian holy magi on 
pages 116–117. Those rules could 
also provide inspiration for Zoroas-
trian holy sahirs, although the ben-
efits of Holy Magic would need to 
be adapted.

94
The Cradle & The Crescent
Few mobeds today possess The Gift. 
This allows them to integrate into society 
easily and take on influential and trusted 
roles. A relatively large proportion of 
mobeds also possess True Faith and may 
perform miracles. This may be because of 
special divine favor, or because only the 
truly devout become priests in a small and 
oppressed religion.
Mobeds in  
Western Eyes
To Western wizards and mages, the 
priests of Zoroaster were an order of 
seers who were dedicated to the service 
of the gods who had strong constitutions 
and lived to a great age, for their pro-
fession as magi made it incumbent upon 
them to observe the strict rules of life. 
The mobeds are known for their pious 
study and worship, their ethics, divina-
tions and prophecy, holy learning, and 
rules of purity.
Few Hermetic wizards would believe 
that the Persian magoi still remain a living 
tradition. The relics, scriptures, and holy 
rituals of the magoi are legend, highly 
sought after. Zoroastrian texts are con-
sidered masterpieces of the magical arts, 
containing everything from hidden truths 
of alchemy, to the names of archangels 
and demon princes. Some Hermetic magi, 
however, believe their knowledge to have 
been primitive.
Mobeds and the  
Suhhar Sulayman
Non-mobed sorcerers before the sev-
enth century were ignored and spurned 
by the Mazdean priesthood. The non-
Mazdean sorcerers of Persia and the Holy 
Land were no match for the great imperial 
powers of the mobeds.
This situation was reversed after the 
seventh century. The Order of Solomon 
became the Suhhar Sulayman, and the 
Islamic sages and sorcerers now reign 
supreme in Persia, while the mobeds are 
an insignificant force on the periphery 
of the civilized world. As in the West, 
their lore, rituals and secrets are greatly 
prized, and their historical knowledge of 
the mystic arts of astrology and alchemy 
is admired, if not associated with the mo-
beds still living.
The Magic  
of the Mobeds
Mobeds practice holy powers, although 
these powers are only bestowed upon those 
initiated into full mobed rank; ervads nor-
mally have no special divine powers. The 
rank of dastur indicates both a political and 
ceremonial rank, and also suggests invest-
ment of some mystic powers.
Mobeds teach as Favored Abilities 
the Holy Method Invocation; the Holy 
Powers Adjuration and Wonders; and the 
Sense Holiness and Unholiness Supernat-
ural Ability. 
Favored Abilities are Supernatural 
Abilities taught by the mobed tradition, 
and for which mobed characters do not 
need to subtract the total of their Su-
pernatural Ability scores from their Ad-
vancement Total (see ArM5, page 166). 
Mobeds also teach a range of non-favored 
Supernatural Abilities, either suffering the 
penalties or initiating them as a Mystery. 
Favored Abilities only impact mobeds 
with True Faith; mobeds without such a 
connection to Ohrmazd must take the ap-
propriate Virtues at character creation, or 
Initiate into them during play.
A great number of Mystery powers 
are available to mobeds, although it is ex-
tremely rare for a community of Mazdeans 
to possess a mobed that knows more than 
one or two.
Mobeds experience the Divine Ascent 
in place of generic Warping or Twilight, 
with Divine Form the most common kind 
of Ascent.
Mazdean Hedge Magic
The mobeds are known for their strong 
alchemical lore; the Videvdat, for example, 
focuses on alchemy and medicine. Mo-
beds may take the Mythic Alchemy and 
Mythic Herbalism Virtues (see Hedge Magic 
Revised Edition, pages 81–82) without the 
need for any further background explana-
tion, and these Virtues are often associated 
with the Divine Realm, rather than Magic. 
However, it is not unusual for a mobed to 
have supernatural powers derived from 
both realms.
Holy Powers
The Holy Powers taught by the mobed 
tradition are spectacular and majestic, 
commanding the forces of nature and cre-
ating life out of nothing. When mobeds 
invoke their divine wonders, they use the 
sacred names of yazdan and the Ameshas-
pand; their prayers call upon the aid of the 
Wise Lord himself. Especially powerful 
mobeds can even call into existence divine 
Supernatural Abilities 
Taught by the Mobeds
Favored Abilities: Invocation, Adju-
ration, Wonders, Sense Holiness 
and Unholiness
Other Abilities (not favored): Ceremo-
ny, Dream Interpretation, Mythic 
Alchemy, Mythic Herbalism
Mobed characters are not limited 
to the Abilities listed here; these are 
simply common to the societas.
New Ability:  
Mobed Lore
This Ability is the Organization 
Lore for the mobeds, and is used for 
their initiation rituals. This lore does 
not give any specific knowledge of 
the Mazdean faith, beliefs, or ritu-
als (this is represented by the Abil-
ity Theology: Mazdean), but rather 
the legends, history, and structure of 
the priesthood, as well as the specific 
initiation rites and oral lore of the 
mobed tradition.

spirits to perform tasks for them and give 
them aid.
Casting Score:  
Communication + Invocation + Holy 
Power + modifiers + aura + die roll
If this total is less than the target Level, 
the effect doesn’t happen, but there might 
be other effects instead, in the form of su-
pernatural retribution. This is called a Trag-
edy of Hubris. It might manifest as a curse, 
a loss of ability, fatigue, a physical injury, 
or even a Flaw. It is also a great opportunity 
for an appropriate story event. This trage-
dy usually lasts only until the character has 
somehow atoned or made amends for his 
presumptuous actions, though the effects 
are sometimes permanent, depending on 
the severity of the transgression.
Minor Tragedy (–1 to –10)
• A Method, Power or other Supernatu-
ral Ability is halved
• Gain a Minor Flaw, e.g., Lesser Male-
diction, Fear, Poor Memory, Simple-
Minded
• Suffer a Medium wound
• Receive three extra botch dice on  
all rolls
• Gain a Warping point
Major Tragedy (–11 to –20)
• A Method, Power or other Supernatu-
ral Ability is lost
• Gain a Major Flaw, e.g., Greater 
Malediction, Blind, or Enfeebled
• Suffer a Heavy wound
• Permanently suffer a minor tragedy
• Gain a Decrepitude point
Ultimate Tragedy (–21 or more)
• All Supernatural Abilities are lost
• Character possessed by a supernatural 
creature
• Suffer an Incapacitating wound
• Permanently suffer a major tragedy
• A terrible plague, war, or famine af-
fects the entire region
Invocation
By addressing God and the servants 
of the Divine, commanding them by their 
names, and entreating them for aid, your 
character can cause holy effects to mani-
fest. This might be because God’s servants 
hear your character’s pleas and intervene, 
or because your character’s understanding 
of God’s word is such that he can wield 
God’s power using God’s voice. This 
typically relies on Communication, and 
requires that the character invest Confi-
dence in the effect.
Adjuration
Adjuration is the Power to summon, 
control and banish supernatural creatures 
of all kinds, including dispelling their 
powers and compelling their coopera-
tion. Through Adjuration, God asserts his 
ultimate authority over creation and both 
the natural and supernatural worlds. Adju-
ration is also the witnessing of oaths and 
truths, by forcing otherworldly beings to 
recognize God’s authority and obey him. 
The target might cry out in pain and won-
der when affected, or speak in a different 
voice that represents its true nature for 
the effect’s duration. Invocation is used 
to compel creatures to act, often forcing 
them to use their powers on the holy char-
acter’s behalf.
Adjuration Guidelines
When these guidelines refer to a su-
pernatural creature, it means a specific 
entity with a Might score.
Level 4: Bind a supernatural creature to 
the terms of a contract. (Invocation)
Level 5: Compel a supernatural creature 
within range to manifest in your 
presence. (Invocation)
Level 10: Compel a supernatural crea-
ture to reveal the truth, even a de-
mon; you may ask one question, and 
if you overcome the creature’s Magic 
Resistance it must answer you hon-
estly. (Invocation)
Level 15: Compel a supernatural crea-
ture to do your bidding; you may 
give it one command which it must 
follow exactly for the duration. 
(Invocation)
Level 20: Compel a mundane crea-
ture to do your bidding, as earlier. 
(Invocation) 
Level 25: Compel a human being to do 
your bidding, as earlier. This com-
mand must be within the person’s 
nature, as evidenced by appropriate 
Personality traits. (Invocation)
True Names
Mobeds may learn and use True 
Names (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
page 34, and also Realms of Power: The 
Divine, page 20). Each True Name is 
treated as a special Ability called “True 
Name of (Being),” and costs 5 experi-
ence points to learn, and once a True 
Name is learned, your character gains 1 
experience point to the being’s associ-
ated Realm Lore. True Names grant a +5 
bonus to Penetration modifiers, and are 
of indefinite duration. 
Mobeds have access to hundreds 
of True Names of angels and demons. 
Characters may start play knowing the 
True Name of one or more beings (see 
the Knowledge of True Name Virtue, earlier 
in this chapter).
Using Vis
Mobeds may use holy and magical 
vis. If a mobed knows certain mysteries, 
he may even extract vis from an aura. 
Holy vis grants the same mechanical 
bonuses as magic vis. The consequenc-
es of profaning holy vis, or using it for 
diabolical ends can be dire, risking Di-
vine retribution.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Wonders
Those who ask properly will receive 
God’s gifts, for God provides for the faith-
ful in need. God also summons storms, fire, 
winds, and other powerful natural forces. 
These wonders are created at the holy 
character’s command, and even controlled 
by him to some extent, although God al-
ways keeps His hand upon His miracles. 
Such things may appear at times to listen 
to another voice, and act in ways that the 
holy character does not anticipate.
These effects use Invocation to conjure 
and command divine forces by their name 
and purpose. When a character suffers a 
Tragedy of Hubris with Wonders, he might 
create unwanted items, such as rotten food, 
vermin, or mud. Or the effect might still 
happen, but completely out of his control.
Holy Virtues
The following virtues are appropriate 
for characters of the mobed tradition.
Adjuration
Major, Supernatural 
This Virtue allows the character to 
command and control supernatural be-
ings, and he begins with the Supernatural 
Ability Adjuration 1.
Dream Interpretation
Major, Supernatural
The character can understand and in-
terpret the secret meaning of dreams. This 
Virtue gives the Supernatural Ability Dream 
Interpretation 1, which may be used in place 
of Meditation to activate Holy Powers and 
also allows him to interpret dreams of a 
general nature. Mobeds may take Dream 
Interpretation, although it is not an Ability 
favored by their tradition. It may, however, 
be Initiated into as a Mystery Virtue.
Invocation
Major, Supernatural 
This Virtue gives the character Invo-
cation 1, a Supernatural Ability which

The Cradle & The Crescent
allows him use the Holy Method of In-
vocation and to roll a stress die for mi-
raculous effects.
Wonders
Major, Supernatural 
The character begins with the Super-
natural Ability Wonders 1, which allows 
him to conjure holy items, creatures, and 
the elements at God’s will.
Holy Abilities
These abilities can be taken by charac-
ters of the mobed tradition.
Adjuration*
The character is skilled in controlling 
and banishing supernatural creatures and 
their powers (see Miraculous Effects, lat-
er). Specialties: type of creatures (angels, 
demons, ghosts, faeries), causing a specific 
effect. (Supernatural)
Dream Interpretation*
In the Mazdean tradition, Ohrmazd 
and His servants regularly send messages 
and prophecies through dreams: Zoro-
aster received visions and guidance from 
the Wise Lord on many occasions. Dream 
interpretation helps mobeds translate the 
confusing symbolism in dreams to make 
clear their deeper meaning.
The Dream Interpretation Ability has 
two uses. The first is a form of Meditation, 
as per the Holy Method, used in combi-
nation with Holy Powers. In this case the 
character must engage in ritual prayer for 
an hour before spending a full night in 
restful sleep. Upon waking the character 
must spend (6 – Dream Interpretation, to 
a minimum of 1) hours contemplating the 
imagery revealed to him in his dream. At 
the end of that time you roll for the mi-
raculous effect as normal. Note that Medi-
tation cannot be used with Adjuration or 
Wonders; see Realms of Power: The Divine, 
page 48. However, mobeds may possess 
other Holy Powers.
The second use is a form of di-
rect divination. In this case the char-
acter is interpreting his own dreams or 
the dreams of others to find answers to 
posed questions. The dreamer must be 
prepared, as per the other use of the 
Dream Interpretation Ability, and upon 
waking the character again spends (6 
– Dream Interpretation, to a minimum of 
1) hours contemplating the imagery. You 
may then make an Intelligence + Dream 
Interpretation roll. Characters with the 
Premonitions Ability gain a bonus equal 
to their Premonitions score.
The Ease Factor is the level of the 
equivalent Momentary non-ritual Intel-
lego Hermetic spell. Holding an arcane 
connection to a target is treated as Touch 
range and the Boundary target does not 
require a ritual. The usual rules for pen-
etration in ArM5, page 184, apply to 
this Ability.
Most who possess the Dream Inter-
pretation Ability have specific rituals that 
they believe help them to achieve insight. 
Some fast before sleeping, some wear rit-
ual clothes while they sleep, while others 
sleep in graveyards in order to gain the as-
sistance of ghosts.
Specialties: Any appropriate Holy 
Power, own dreams or the dreams of oth-
ers, dreams had under specific circum-
stances (Supernatural)
Invocation*
Using holy words, phrases and 
prayers, 
the 
character 
can 
invoke 
Ohrmazd’s power. He must either cry out 
his prayer in a loud voice, or somehow 
inscribe his prayer in writing. This adds 
the character’s Communication to your 
roll, and requires that he spend a point of 
Confidence (or Faith) to bring the effect 
into being. 
You may also roll a stress die instead 
of a simple die when calling a holy effect 
if you wish. By doing so, the character es-
sentially commands rather than entreat 
God’s aid, summoning more potential 
power but risking giving greater offense 
should he prove unworthy.
Specialties: using holy names, in writ-
ing, affecting a particular kind of target. 
(Supernatural) 
New Wonders Guidelines
General: Create a sacred spiritual force 
that that can neutralize the spiritu-
al taint of the Infernal Realm. For 
example, the force could trans-
form Infernal Warping into Divine 
Warping (1 Warping Point per level 
of effect is transfigured), although 
the Warping itself is not removed. 
The power can strip the infernal 
nature of Infernal vis, completely 
destroying the vis (1 pawn of vis 
per 3 levels of effect). It can also 
destroy Confidence Points gained 
through committing sin (1 Con-
fidence Point per 5 levels); note 
that doing this causes the target to 
feel great remorse for the acts they 
performed to gain the Infernally 
gained Confidence Points (this 
does not work against demons, but 
can work against other creatures 
with Infernal Might). (Invocation)
	
Create a sacred force that acts as 
the Scourging the Infernal power 
radiated by relics (Realms of Power: 
The Divine, page 45), forcing infer-
nal beings to flee (note that this is 
an equivalent effect, not a true relic 
power). Use the level of the effect 
in place of the Divine Might of the 
relic when calculating the effect of 
the aura. (Invocation)
Level 35: Create a spirit with Divine 
Might 5. Each 5 points of addition-
al Might increases the Level by 10. 
(Invocation)

The Cradle & The Crescent
Wonders*
The character can cause living crea-
tures, non-living objects, and forces of 
nature to manifest through God’s power 
(see Miraculous Effects, later). Special-
ties: causing a specific effect, a particular 
kind of material, in specific circumstanc-
es. (Supernatural)
Group Magic
Mobeds can practice their magic col-
lectively. In times past, when they were an 
imperial priesthood, hundreds of mobeds 
would gather to perform great rituals in 
honor of Ohrmazd and his angels. In the 
13th century, few communities have more 
than a few Mazdean priests and those that 
do are unlikely to possess the knowledge 
of such powerful rites.
To perform group powers, mobeds use 
the Ceremony Ability (see Realms of Power: 
The Divine, pages 34–36), and engage in 
prayers and rituals. Most of these are com-
munal in nature, and so laypeople will 
often participate (although this gives no 
mechanical bonus).
Holy Mobed Mysteries
The mobeds have several unique mys-
teries that are holy in nature (that is, they 
can only be initiated by a character with 
Holy Powers or True Faith). Many allow 
mobeds to wield mystical powers.
Blessing of [Ameshaspand] 
(Minor Mystery Virtue)
The mobed with this holy mystery 
gets a +3 bonus to Casting Scores for 
holy powers used in the area covered by 
a specific Ameshaspand (see list). There 
is a different version of this virtue for 
each Ameshaspand.
Ameshaspand: Asha Vahishta 
Meaning: “Best Righteousness”
Equivalent Form(s): Ignem, Imaginem
Ameshaspand: Khshathra Vairya
Meaning: “Desirable Dominion”
Equivalent Form(s): Vim
Ameshaspand: Haurvatat
Meaning: “Health”
Equivalent Form(s): Aquam, Auram
Ameshaspand: Spenta Armaiti
Meaning: “Holy Devotion”
Equivalent Form(s): Terram
Ameshaspand: Ameretat
Meaning: “Long Life”
Equivalent Form(s): Herbam
Ameshaspand: Vohu Manah
Meaning: “Good Purpose”
Equivalent Form(s): Animal
Ameshaspand: Spenta Mainyu
Meaning: “Holy Spirit”
Equivalent Form(s): Corpus, Mentem
Mazdean Alchemy  
(Minor Mystery Virtue)
Through Mazdean Alchemy, a mobed 
may distill vis from a Divine Aura. Dis-
tilling divine vis takes a season before 
the vis is extracted. The character uses as 
his Lab Total his Intelligence + Invoca-
tion + Wonders + Holy Magic + modi-
fiers. Modifiers include the aura, bonuses 
from Lab assistants and so on. The Lab 
Total is divided by 10, as per Hermetic 
vis extraction.
Mazdean Astrology  
(Major Mystery Virtue)
This Mystery allows the character to 
use his knowledge of the heavens to de-
termine the most effective time to pay or 
use holy powers. The mobed may also use 
new astrological durations.
Celestial Durations
No duration may be longer than a 
year. Failing the calculation roll causes the 
effect to fail. Botching a calculation roll 
causes the effect to botch.
Minutes: The effect lasts for a certain 
number of astrological minutes. Equiv-
alent to Diameter. To calculate the 
duration correctly, succeed in a roll of 
Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice 
against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number 
of Minutes desired.
Hours: The effect lasts a number of astro-
logical hours, regardless of sunrise or 
sunset. Equivalent to Sun. To calculate 
the duration correctly, succeed in a roll 
of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice 
against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number 
of Hours desired.
Days: The effect lasts a number of astro-
logical days, regardless of the lunar 
phase. Equivalent to Moon. To calcu-
late the duration correctly, succeed in 
a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales 
+ dice against an Ease Factor of 6 + 
Number of Days desired.
Sign: The effect lasts a number of astro-
logical signs, regardless of sunrise or 
sunset. Equivalent to Year. To calculate 
Mobed Beliefs on Astrology
According to the holy Zoroastrian 
tome, the Dadistan i Menok i Khrat (“Judg-
ments of the Spirit of Wisdom”), the art 
of Astrology was passed from the Spirit 
of Wisdom to Zoroaster.
Mobeds believe that welfare and 
adversity on Earth originates through 
the seven planets and the twelve zo-
diacal signs. To the mobeds, the twelve 
great Spirits of the Zodiac are among 
Ohrmazd’s most capable and holy de-
fenders, constantly striving to bring 
goodness and wellbeing into the world. 
The planets (the Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn), on 
the other hand, are ruled by monstrous 
demons, which, by dint of being closer 
to the world, constantly thwart their 
zodiacal rivals and more often than not 
succeed in bringing ruin and misery to 
humanity (an explanation of why Earth 
is not a paradise).

The Cradle & The Crescent
the duration correctly, succeed in a roll 
of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice 
against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number 
of Signs desired.
Astrological minutes, hours, and days 
are equal in length to normal units of time, 
but have no fixed starting point, so that the 
effect lasts a fixed length of time, rather 
than until a fixed point. Astrological signs 
are, similarly, one-twelfth of a year each.
Celestial Blessing  
for Holy Spell Casting
The mobed may determine the most 
favorable hour for performing holy magic, 
holy powers or use other divine abilities. 
By aligning his practices to the beneficial 
powers of the stars, he may gain a bonus 
of +1 to +5. The player must decide on 
the activity and bonus desired before roll-
ing, and succeed in a roll of Intelligence 
+ Artes Liberales (Astrology) + simple die 
against an Ease Factor of (desired bonus x 
4). If successful, the mobed determines an 
hour during that day (selected by the sto-
ryguide) in which the activity will benefit 
from the desired bonus. If the mobed does 
not perform the chosen activity in that 
hour, there is no benefit. A mobed may 
perform this calculation multiple times 
for a single day, but each hour may have 
no more than one bonus. A failed roll in-
dicates that the mobed can find no more 
bonuses for that day.
Righteousness of the Wise 
(Minor Mystery Virtue)
Mobeds believe that Spenta Mainyu 
revealed these secrets (and others) di-
rectly to Zoroaster before taking him to 
Ohrmazd. For many mobeds, the attribute 
of wisdom is the highest nature of God. 
This Mystery Virtue grants the mobed 
access to unique Ranges, Durations, and 
Targets that are compatible with Holy 
Powers (see insert). 
Saoshyant’s Elixir  
(Major Mystery Virtue)
The ritual of Saoshyant’s Elixir (Realms 
of Power: The Divine, page 117) is the Zoro-
astrian route to immortality. The ceremo-
New Durations, Ranges, and Targets
New Duration: Fire
The spell will last as long as a specific 
sacred fire burns in a specific fire temple 
(the fire and temple must be determined 
at the time of casting the spell). Fire is 
equivalent to Moon.
New Range: Ground
The target can be affected so long as 
he/it is touching the same ground that 
the caster is standing upon. The caster 
need not be able to see the target. Riv-
ers, mountains and other significant ob-
stacles (although not roads or walls) act 
as boundaries to this range. Furthermore, 
the ground must be natural earth. Artificial 
ground, like floorboards or cobble stones, 
puts a target out of this Range. Ground is 
equivalent to Arcane Connection.
New Target: Community
Affects everyone living in the same 
community. A community is defined as 
a group of people living in the same lo-
cality, or who form a distinct segment 
of society (such as Jews, beggars, or 
Christians, but can also include plants 
or animals). Community is equivalent 
to Boundary.
Saoshyant’s Elixir
Invocation Wonders Level 50
R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual
Only the most pious, holy and ex-
perienced mobeds ever attempt the 
preparation of Saoshyant’s elixir. This 
holy ritual requires a season of prepara-
tion to cast.
These are the instructions for prepar-
ing the elixir of eternal life, that which 
raises our bodies from the elements into 
which they have been dissolved and re-
unites them with our souls, as handed 
down from Saoshyant the Savior.
The mobed must first prepare him-
self for salvation by undergoing a ter-
rible ordeal. Molten metal (usually lead) 
is poured over his entire body, which 
he must endure for three days (see Inju-
ries, Heat and Corrosion in ArM5, page 
181). The surging metal removes all taint 
from his soul and purifies his flesh, but 
also causes him terrible pain and injury, 
though it is said to feel like being bathed 
in warm milk if the mobed is completely 
without sin. Some of the metal prob-
ably sticks to his body, and if he survives 
he must bear these disfiguring patches 
grafted to his skin like tattoos for the rest 
of his days, as removing them again ex-
poses him to evil and undoes the effects 
of the ritual. 
Once the mobed are is of evil, he 
must sacrifice a holy animal, usually a 
bull with Divine Might. This provides 
the necessary vis for the spell, and from 
its fat Saoshyant’s elixir may be distilled. 
Drink this, and for as long as the mobed 
strictly follows the tenets of Mazdean-
ism, he does not have to make aging 
rolls and cannot die. Instead, he gains 
a Warping point every year, another 
whenever he gains Aging or Decrepitude 
points from other means, and another 
when he would die from his wounds or 
a lethal blow. Fatal wounds Incapacitate 
him instead.
Saoshyant’s Elixir is intensely person-
al and cannot be cast upon another; to 
gain the gift of extended life on earth, a 
mobed must perform it himself.

The Cradle & The Crescent
ny itself is a sacred and holy purification 
rite. Gaining this Mystery Virtue grants 
you knowledge of the ritual, which can 
be performed with the Holy Method and 
Power, Invocation and Wonders. Like the 
ritual in Realms of Power: The Divine, the level 
of this holy rite is 50.
Gifts of Gayomart  
(Major Mystery Virtue)
Gayomart (“Primeval Man”) was the 
Zoroastrian Adam or “first man,” and is 
seen as the embodiment of human perfec-
tion. This Holy Mystery opens the human 
body and soul to the Light of God, mak-
ing those characters with True Faith even 
more holy and sacred.
A character must possess True Faith to 
initiate this mystery. The mystery grants 
the character additional powers as his 
True Faith score increases (see “Embody-
ing the Light,” Realms of Power: The Divine, 
page 61).
Asha (Truth): True Faith 1
The character cannot be lied to or 
purposefully deceived. In his presence, no 
one may speak or communicate a direct 
lie. This power has a Penetration equal to 
his True Faith score, and may be increased 
by +5 for each Faith point spent. If this 
power Penetrates, even demons and faer-
ies cannot deceive him.
Vohu Manah (Good Mind):  
True Faith 4
Through Vohu Mana, the mobed per-
sonifies wisdom and the true path to God. 
He gains a Commanding Aura (Realms of 
Power: The Divine, page 42), which grants 
a bonus to his soak equal to twice his 
True Faith score, and a commanding aura 
(equivalent to Aura of Rightful Author-
ity with Voice range). (The normal Com-
manding Aura also grants Magic Resis-
tance, but True Faith grants that anyway.)
Hauvatat (Wholeness):  
True Faith 6
The mobed’s physical body becomes 
immune to putrefaction, change, disease 
and all forms of material corruption and 
decay. Subtract double the character’s 
True Faith score from Aging Rolls. He 
more easily resists magical attempts to 
alter the shape of his body, inflict harm 
upon him or give him diseases or wounds. 
He gains an additional bonus to Soak and 
Recovery rolls equal to his True Faith 
Score x3 (giving a total bonus to Soak to-
tals of True Faith x5, with the bonus from 
Vohu Manah). Furthermore, he no longer 
scars or blemishes, as his body slowly re-
turns to its perfect natural state. Incapaci-
tating wounds no longer leave permanent 
marks upon him, and given enough time 
(years) he can re-grow lost limbs and 
other body parts.
Ameratat (Immortality):  
 True Faith 8
So long as the mobed maintain the 
maxims of Zoroaster and Ohrmazd, re-
mains in a state of purity and truthfulness, 
observes the taboos and behaves with 
good thoughts, good words and good 
deeds, he will never die, and gain Warping 
Points instead of Decrepitude points. Me-
chanically this requires that the character 
have a Faith Point gained from a purity 
ritual at all times. His body slowly ages, 
although he can more easily resist its ef-
fects through the gift of Hauvatat. While 
this virtue means the character effectively 
will never die, he can still be killed by mas-
sive damage.
Mobed Initiations
Mobeds can initiate unGifted practi-
tioners into their mysteries. The rules for 
this are laid out in Hedge Magic Revised Edi-
tion, page 13. 
Mobed Initiation Scripts
Mobeds use their Mobed Lore for ini-
tiation totals. The mystagogue is typically 
another initiated mobed or dastur. It is 
possible for mobeds to self-initiate if they 
have a script but no mystagogue, although 
most mobeds seek out a mystagogue from 
another community.
The scripts used by mobeds to Initiate 
their various powers typically emphasize ex-
treme purity and lengthy prayers. Initiations 
can also require the initiate to challenge and 
overcome great foes — powerful demons 
and evil sorcerers. Similarly, Ordeals could 
also require the initiate to end famine, hun-
ger or disease for a community. Initiation 
Quests typically involve the establishment 
of a fire temple, the conversion of a sig-
nificant or notable person, or recovery and 
proper burial of a deceased Mazdean.
While there are many written Initia-
tion Scripts, Mazdeanism places great val-
ue on the oral tradition; many of the living 
Initiations are oral Scripts.
Initiation into  
Mythic Alchemy
Initiation Ease Factor: 21
Script Bonus: +5 (+3 Quest: light 
ceremonial fire, +1 Sacrifice of wealth, 
+1 time)
The initiate must light one of the 
grand ceremonial fires of the Mazdean 
faith, known as the atesh adaran , in honor 
of the first 27 yazdan, and Ameratat. This 
typically takes a season to properly prepare 
and perform, and takes significant expen-
diture. The initiate must remain in a state 
of ritual purity throughout the process.

Long-Lived Mobeds
There have been several long-lived 
mobeds: the high priests Vishtana, 
Tansar, and Kartir all lived for several 
generations, as did Osthanes, the first 
Prince of Magi. However, each reached 
a point of wanting to take their reward 
in the next life. The practical lifespan of 
a mobed with the Ameratat power is no 
more than around 200 years.

The intitiate must must hunt down 
and destroy a powerful disease-causing 
Infernal spirit, while affected by the ill-
ness that the spirit causes. The illness 
must inflict the equivalent of the En-
feebled Major Flaw. This shows that he 
is capable of personally overcoming ter-
rible sickness mystically and physically. 
Apart from the illness, the initiate must 
remain in a state of ritual purity through-
out the initiation.
Initiation into  
Dream Interpretation
Initiation Ease Factor: 21
Script Bonus: +6 (+1 time, +3 Sym-
pathetic bonus, +3 Minor Flaw: Offensive 
to Animals)
Dream Interpretation can only be 
intitiated into by a Mazdean who is mar-
ried by the Mazdean ritual. The intitiate 
must spend a season in meditation, prayer, 
ritual cleansing, and contemplation of his 
dreams. Finally, at the end of the season, 
the initiate must travel deep into the wil-
derness in an area with many wild animals, 
imbibe ceremonial haoma, and survive for 
the night without magical aid. During this 
night, and thereafter, the initiate has the 
Offensive to Animals Flaw. Overcoming 
this obstacle symbolises the intitiate’s tri-
umph over nightmares.

Arabia is the heartland of Islam, 
home to the two holy cities of Mecca 
and Medina. Muslims are encouraged 
to visit this region at some point during 
their lives to fulfill the obligation of the 
hajj — the greater pilgrimage to Mecca 
— though for many practical concerns 
make this impossible. 
Ancient cities lie buried beneath the 
sands of Arabia, holy shrines are scattered 
across its landscape, and jinn and other su-
pernatural creatures haunt deserted ruins 
and even mix with the inhabitants of some 
of its cities.
Landscape  
and Society
The landscape of Arabia is more varied 
than most western travelers would expect. 
North Arabia, once known as Arabia Petra 
to the Romans, is a desert land of stone 
and sand. While much of the peninsula 
is indeed covered by arid deserts, there 
are also mountain ranges running paral-
lel to most of the coastal regions, with 
narrow but fertile coastal plains between 
them and the sea. Of particular note is a 
large high plateau in the eastern half of 
the peninsula, encompassing the prov-
inces of the Najd and Yamama, which has 
fertile valleys where crops are grown and 
animals (mainly sheep and goats) are pas-
tured. In the south, the land rises into hills 
and mountains rich with incense trees, 
water, and other natural resources — sig-
nificant portions of Hadramawt and Ye-
men are forested, and these features gave 
rise to the Roman name for the province, 
Arabia Felix. The old trade routes of the 
incense road that once ran through the 
deserts now track through the Red Sea 
around the Arabian coast and onwards to 
the fabled ports of the Erythraean Sea of 
the ancients. 
Much of the peninsula is dotted with 
oases, around which villages and towns 
have sprung up. This is particularly true 
of the coastal provinces and the Najd/
Yamama region, though such settlements 
may also be found in some of the des-
erts. The exception is the dreaded Empty 
Quarter, an inhospitable wasteland that 
is rumored to swallow all who venture 
into it.
The inhabitants of Arabia consist 
of a mixture of settled townsfolk, many 
of whom cultivate crops for a living, 
and Bedouin nomads who wander with 
their families and flocks, trading with 
the townsfolk or working as guides and 
caravan guards on the network of trade 
and pilgrimage routes that cross the area. 
Periodically tensions flare up between 
townsfolk and nomads, but for the most 
part relations are peaceful. One influen-
tial factor here is the religion of Islam, 
which most people follow in one form 
or another, although there are also many 
Christians and Jews living throughout 
the region.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The inhabited parts of Arabia are gen-
erally ruled by local dynasties, most of 
whom owe nominal allegiance to the Ab-
basid caliph of Baghdad. The Hijaz, ‘Asir, 
and Yemen are divided between members 
of the Ayyubid family ((ay-YOO-bids), 
the family of Salah al-Din (Saladin)), 
with the Hijaz falling under the nominal 
control of the sultan of Egypt (al-Kamil 
Muhammad, r. 1218–38), while ‘Asir and 
Yemen are controlled more directly by 
the sultan of Yemen (al-Mas’ud Yusuf, r. 
1215–1229).
Hazards of the Deserts
Arabia contains three major deserts: 
the Nefud Desert to the north, the Empty 
Quarter to the south, and the Dahna cor-
ridor that links the two. These deserts 
present a range of hazards that must be 
overcome if characters are to travel safely 
within them.
The sun burns hot in the deserts, 
meaning that characters need to take pre-
cautions against heat and sunstroke. This 
includes covering their skin to avoid sun-
burn and carrying adequate supplies of 
water to stave off dehydration. The De-
privation check time for lack of water is 
reduced in the deserts to 4 hours, while 
the sunlight does +1 non-combat damage 
if skin is left exposed (see ArM5, pages 
180–181).
Another (usually natural) hazard is dry 
quicksands, which can swallow a man and 
his mount in seconds. If a character steps on 
one of these, he begins to sink immediate-
ly and is pulled under within two rounds. 
Death from suffocation follows if he is not 
rescued (again, see ArM5, pages 180–181). 
A character who is caught in an area of dry 
quicksand may make a Strength or Quick-
ness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in

The zawba’a is aware of everything 
happening in the area that it haunts, 
which can be up to a Structure in

Vis: When the zawba’a is destroyed, it 
leaves behind a small whirling col-
umn of black sand that if collected 
yields 3 pawns of Terram vis and 1 
pawn of Auram vis.
Appearance: In corporeal form, the 
zawba’a appears as a column of sand 
whirling at high speed, within the 
heart of which chuckles a malicious, 
bloodthirsty face. It is about 8 ft tall.
The zawba’a is a bloodthirsty jinni of 
the Arabian deserts, which takes delight 
in slaying anyone unfortunate enough 
to stray across its path. It is, however, 
a rather single-minded creature and is 
unlikely to adopt any tactic beyond the 
frontal assault, making it relatively easy 
to outwit.
Some experienced sahirs are able 
to bargain with zawba’a and bind them 
as servants using the khadim bond (see 
Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman). 
Such sahirs often use these desert jinn 
as a form of travel — the sight of a 
powerful sorcerer being carried across 
the landscape by a whirling sandstorm 
instead of a mundane mount strikes re-
spect into even the most powerful of 
mundane rulers!
Story Seed: Death by Zawba’a?
The characters are called in to inves-
tigate a murder. The victim was found 
flayed to death in his chamber, which 
was covered in a fine layer of sand. In-
vestigating, the characters uncover a 
plot by a shadowy cabal of sahirs from 
a minor Islamic sect who have learned 
to bind the zawba’a, deadly jinn whirl-
winds, to their service. The sahirs use 
them as weapons against their political 
enemies, unleashing them on unsuspect-
ing victims. Is this what happened here, 
and if so, who was responsible?

The Cradle & The Crescent
the first round to leap or pull himself free 
before he sinks a significant distance, with 
a botch indicating that his arms are trapped 
in the following round. Thereafter it is up 
to his companions to help him escape its 
clutches, though if his arms are free he may 
assist in the second round, reducing any 
further Ease Factors that he may have to 
roll against by 3. Thereafter he has been 
pulled under and is not able to help.
Characters also must be wary of brig-
ands, who prey on caravans crossing the 
deserts. They are likely to avoid a cara-
van that is clearly well-guarded, but this 
depends on how desperate they are for 
goods to support themselves.
Sandstorms may suffocate travelers or 
even strip the flesh from their bones. These 
may be natural, created by the magic of 
malevolent sorcerers or the manifestations 
of elemental jinn. The zawba’a, detailed in 
the nearby insert, is an example of a mali-
cious jinn of whirling sand.
Various other desert jinn and demons 
seek to harm unwary travelers. In some 
cases they may use powers that affect the 
mind or conjure illusions, presenting trav-
elers with visions of lush, palm-filled oa-
ses where they may quench their thirsts. 
A character may only realize that she has 
been deceived when she takes her first 
long draught of water, only to find her 
mouth full of sand.
The Bedouin
Although the nomads of northern 
Arabia have nominally all converted to 
Sunni Islam, remnants of their pre-Is-
lamic culture or code, known as muru’a, 
have survived. The importance of hos-
pitality (diyafa), courage (hamasa), and 
honor (sharaf for men, ird for women) 
remain paramount and color aspects of 
even urban Arab society. Forgiveness, 
loyalty, and self-sacrifice are also integral 
concepts. The Bedouin tribes still revere 
the camel above all animals, according it 
greater respect than even the magnificent 
Arabian horse or their prized falcons. 
Most Arabian sahirs belong to a Bedouin 
tribe and comparatively few dwell within 
cities or formal buyut, preferring to form 
alliances along tribal kinship and blood-
lines. Due to the rich sources of vis in 
the area, the Bedouin wizards are heav-
ily involved in magical trade with their 
urban sahir cousins, exchanging vis for 
rare books on the Solomonic Arts or even 
personal teaching. 
Bedouin characters may have Per-
sonality Traits or Personality Flaws that 
reflect these cultural legacies. The Minor 
Flaw Dutybound (Bedouin code) is all but 
universal among Bedouin characters and 
reflects a general obedience to these cus-
toms. Rare characters from the deep des-
erts may even have the Pagan Major Flaw. 
Many Faerie jinn mimic aspects of 
Bedouin culture, particularly the less 
powerful creatures referred to as jann. 
Most of the nomadic tribes have jinn-
blooded elders, are advised by wandering 
sahir viziers accompanied by powerful 
‘afrit or marid servants, and count fami-
lies of true Faerie jann among their blood 
kinsmen. Such jinn most often take the 
shapes of animals beloved of the tribes: 
camels, falcons, saluqi hounds, or the 
noble Arabian horses. The ancient Ju-
rhumite tribe, former rulers of Mecca 
in pre-Islamic times, contains only dark 
Faerie jann-blooded members and still 
refuses to submit to Islam. Several other 
Saluqi
Although most dogs (kalb) are con-
sidered unclean by non-Maliki school 
Muslims, the noble breed known as the 
saluqi are prized by their masters, often 
sleeping in the tents of their Bedouin 
owners and being lauded in poetry af-
ter their passing. Prized both for their 
beauty and hunting skill, these grey-
hound-like dogs act as coursers, oper-
ating either in speedy packs or as bird 
dogs in tandem with falcons. Details on 
hunting with hounds are given in Lords of 
Men, Chapter 5: Leisure.
Saluqi use the base statistics for 
greyhounds listed in The Book of Mun-
dane Beasts or Realms of Power: Magic, 
page 143, modified accordingly: add 
the following Qualities: Grapple, Im-
posing Appearance x2, Keen Eyesight 
and drop Keen Sense of Smell; add the 
Endurance Virtue and an additional Im-
proved Characteristics Virtue; increase 
Presence to +1 and Stamina to +3; 
change to Hunt 4 (track by sight). Ex-
ceptional saluqi may have the Puissant 
Hunt Virtue and have powers similar to 
Faerie Hounds as detailed in Realms of 
Power: Faerie, pages 88–89.
Arabian Steeds
The Bedouin are known for their 
fine horses, but also use dromedary 
camels in war and trade. Their jinni 
cousins may ride more exotic mounts 
such as giant ostriches, leopards, or 
even stranger beasts.
For a mundane Arabian racehorse, 
use the statistics for the Courser given 
in the Book of Mundane Beasts (see Realms 
of Power: Magic, or the Atlas Games web-
site) and add the Imposing Appearance 
x2 Quality and the Great Quickness Mi-
nor Virtue, raising the beast’s Presence 
to +1 and Quickness to +3. Similar Ara-
bian steeds bred for war or other roles 
can be created using the base Destrier 
or Charger as templates and adding the 
aforementioned traits.
For a single-humped dromedary 
camel, use the statistics for Bactrian 
camels (Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) 
with the following modifications: de-
crease Strength to +1 and Stamina to 
+3, and increase Dex to 0. Drop the 
Long-Winded Virtue and the Feral 
Scent Flaw. Drop the Hardy Quality 
and decrease Fatigue Levels by one. 
Reputation is Cranky +1 (much of Ara-
bia). Change combat statistics to: Init 0, 
Attack +4, Defense +2, Damage +2 and 
Soak +3. Change to Survival 3 (home 
terrain). Full statistics for dromedary 
camels are given in Magi of Hermes, pages 
10–11.

The Cradle & The Crescent
tribes from the ancient times are believed 
to live on in Bedouin memory as clans of 
Faerie jinn,such as the Jadis, the tribe of 
Tasm and the Thamudites
Regardless of whether he is human or 
jinn, Muslim or pagan, a member of a Bed-
ouin clan owes absolute loyalty to his clan 
first, his family second. 
Bedouin Wizards
A disproportionately large number of 
Bedouin possess supernatural ability when 
compared to the town dwellers in the set-
tled parts of Arabia. It has been noted that 
Bedouin sahirs are more often Gifted than 
their fellows in other areas of the Mythic 
Middle East. Such sahirs typically special-
ize in either Solomonic Storytelling or 
Solomonic Travel, although some Bedouin 
sahirs disdain the more specific techniques 
and concentrate on summoning and bar-
gaining with jinn exclusively. These sahirs 
are usually accompanied by their favorite 
falcon or saluqi, which is actually a Faerie 
jinn servant bound by a khadim bond (see 
Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for fur-
ther details on sahirs). 
All tribes include at least one sahir, of-
ten supported by female hedge magicians 
known as hakima (“wise women”) or kahina 
(“soothsayers”) that resemble Folk Witch-
es aligned to the Faerie Realm, or male 
shai’ir, poets resembling the ancient artists 
of pre-Islamic times. The unGifted hedge 
witches typically lack the Cursing and 
Flight powers and have the Animal Heal-
ing and Entrancement Virtues instead. 
Details of Folk Witches can be found in 
Hedge Magic, pages 33–53, although some 
of the ideas for Faerie Doctors presented 
in Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 117–118, 
may be equally appropriate. Details on 
Arabian poets are given in the sidebar on 
Arab Poetry later.
Brothers of the Tribe
Knowledge of muru’a is treated like 
a non-Hermetic Mystery Cult Organi-
zation Lore that can be learned like any 
other Ability. It is used to initiate various 
Faerie-aligned Supernatural Virtues of 
value to a desert nomad using the rules 
found in The Mysteries: Revised Edition, pages 
8–20, with the tribe’s hakima acting as 
Mystagogue. The following Virtues can 
be initiated and are commonly possessed 
by exceptional Bedouin: Animal Ken, Art 
of Memory, Arcadian Travel, Cursing, 
Death Prophecy, Dowsing, Enchanting 
Pagan Deities of Arabia
Trees, especially the date-palm, wind-
sculpted rocks and precious wells are treat-
ed with a respect that borders on the wor-
shipful by the Bedouin — many of these 
sites are the abode of a supernatural spirit 
referred to as an ‘ashira (“close friend”). 
These creatures are appeased with gifts or 
respect and their homes are typically the 
location of auras or vis sources aligned to 
the various Elemental forms.
Some of the more powerful ‘ashira 
are Magic jinn, genii loci manifestations 
of Arab deities worshiped in pre-Islamic 
Arabia, or else Infernal jinn that have 
usurped their place. The following rep-
resents a selection of such deities:
Abgal: Guardian god of Bedouin and 
camel drivers.
Dhu’l-Khalasa: God of oracles and 
divination.
Dhu Shara: God of mountains.
Hubal: Senior deity associated with the 
moon and divination.
Ishtar: Goddess of fertility, sexual love, 
and war. More commonly wor-
shiped in ancient Mesopotamia.
Manaf: A fertility deity worshiped by 
women, though women were not 
allowed to touch its idols during 
their time of menstruation.
Nakhla: Goddess of the date-palm tree.
Al-Qawm: God of war and the night. 
Protector of caravans.
Sa’d: Associated with steadfastness in 
battle.
Wadd: Protector god.
Yaghuth: Associated with victory in 
battle.
The nature of such old deities may 
vary and multiple entities bearing the 
same name can be found within miles 
of each other, but with widely differ-
ent realm alignment and power. The 
benevolent version of Wadd venerated 
by a tribe from northern Najd may be 
an aloof Magic jinni, while the vengeful 
Infernal incarnation of the same deity 
feared by tribes in Uman may be a False 
God trying to subvert the nomads away 
from their faith. Others may be Faerie 
jinn woven out of the stories told by the 
Bedouin at their night fires about such 
fantastic natural locations. The weakest 
may be no more powerful than a minor 
elemental jinn with a Might score of less 
than 10, whereas the spirits of larger 
and more isolated landmarks may have 
Might scores approaching 50.
Story Seed:  
The Stone Lovers
A group of magi or sahirs wish-
ing to settle a pair of uniquely shaped 
rock outcrops in a remote Magic aura 
inadvertently offend the local Bed-
ouin tribe, who consider the stones 
‘ashiras and thus part of their tribe. 
Their legends tell of two giants, Aja 
and Salma, banished lovers who dwelt 
for five hundred years at the site, slow-
ly transforming into the vaguely hu-
man-shaped stone sentinels of today. 
The tribe fears that the wizards will 
awaken the spirits of the ossified gi-
ants or draw the attention of the dark 
Faerie and Infernal jinn that haunt the 
outcrops at night.
To settle in the area or access vis 
from the site, the characters must not 
only deal with the representatives of 
the local tribe, but also the evil jinn that 
haunt it. Frequent magical activity may 
awaken the sleeping giants, who may 
not respond favorably to the interlopers 
depending on whether they are elemen-
tals, demons, pre-Islamic jinn or even 
cursed humans.

Falconry in Arabia
Believed by some to have originated 
in Mesopotamia, the art of falconry, or 
al-Qanas, is widely practiced through-
out Arabia, particularly by the Bedouin 
tribesmen. Unlike in Mythic Europe, the 
primary goal of hawking is to supplement 
the meager nomad diet, particularly in 
the winter months. An exceptional bird, 
particularly one of the better-suited fe-
males, is still considered a mark of status 
by tribal leaders. The main prey hunted 
are the houbara, the karwan (stone curlew), 
and the hare. The most commonly used 
bird is the saqr, similar to the gyrfalcon, 
but the peregrine falcon, known as the 
shahin, is sometimes preferred. 
The authority on falconry is an 
unnamed Arabic text by the falconer 
Moamyn, equivalent to a summa Level 4, 
Quality 7 on Animal Handling (falcon-
ry), but also containing the equivalent of 
a tractatus on Hunt (hawking), Quality 
7. In the next decade it will be translated 
into Latin as the De Scientia Venandi per Aves 
by Master Theodore of Antioch at the 
court of King Frederick II, with a resul-
tant Quality of only 6. By 1250, the work 
will have been corrected and glossed by 
the Stupor Mundi himself, resulting in the 
superior work known as De arte venandi 
cum avibus (Quality 8) which becomes 
widely copied.
See Lords of Men, Chapter 5: Leisure, 
for further details on hawking and Realms 
of Power: Magic, page 86, for training ani-
mals using magic. 
Saqr
Similar to its European cousin the 
gyrfalcon, detailed in The Book of Mundane 
Beasts, Realms of Power, page 142, or Lords of 
Men, page 59, the bird most commonly 
used by Arabian falconers is the saqr. 
Known for its endurance rather than its 
speed, the saqr has the following modifi-
cations: add the Tireless Quality and the 
Long-Winded Virtue. Exceptional saqr, 
especially prized by the nomad sheikhs, 
possess the Puissant Hunt Virtue and the 
Imposing Appearance x2 Quality.
Shahin
These smaller hawks are equiva-
lent to the peregrine falcons of Europe. 
These Size –4 raptors are the fastest 
falcons but have much less endurance. 
They excel in catching smaller birds 
on the wing, but are less suited for des-
ert hawking. Increase the basic falcon’s 
Quickness by 1 but subtract 2 from 
Strength, change to Ambush Predator, 
add Stealth 3 (ambush prey), decrease 
to Flight 3 (climbing flight) and modify 
their combat statistics accordingly.
Anqa
The Arabian phoenix, or anqa, is very 
similar to the rukh detailed in Chapter 9: 
On the Silk Road — its coloration con-
sists of bright red, orange and gold. Like 
an Eagle of Virtue, as the anqa ages its 
feathers grow dim and it flies to its aerie 
above the Mountains of Qaf. There, im-
molating itself in flame, it is reborn as a 
single black egg. Hermetic magi observ-
ing this process over a season can treat 
the experience as a significatos, gaining 
experience in the Arts of Animal, Ignem, 
or Vim. 
Story Seed:  
The Seven Falcons of Lukman
Legend tells of the longevity of Luk-
man. One day, the son of ‘Ad heard a 
voice calling to him and discovered a 
nest with two falcon fledglings. Choos-
ing the stronger, he brought it up as his 
boon companion. The falcon lived for a 
full 80 years and the falconer aged not a 
day. When it died, he returned to the nest 
to discover another fledgling, which lived 
another 80 years. Once again, Lukman 
retained his youth. He repeated this an-
other five times, growing sadder with the 
passing of each successive hawk. The sev-
enth falcon he named Lubad, “the accu-
mulation of all times,” and when it passed, 
the weight of five centuries crashed down 
on Lukman and he finally died.
The nest lies within a Magic regio, 
accessible only after an arduous climb in 
western Arabia. Each fledgling, if raised 
and trained as a companion, grants its 
trainer immunity from all Aging rolls for 
a fixed duration of 80 years. Each year, 
the owner gains a single Warping Point. 
The falcon’s boon is incompatible with 
standard Hermetic Longevity Rituals or 
similar magic. Once the falcon dies, the 
owner suffers from the Age Quickly Flaw 
until he raises the next hatchling. Unlike 
a normally fragile hawk, the bird does not 
need to make Aging rolls until it reaches 
80 years old at which point it suddenly 
dies without a roll. The bird has a Magic 
Might of 8 and the Unaffected by The 
Gift Minor Virtue. It can be slain or die 
by other mundane means.
The tale of Lukman reaches the char-
acters and they may wish to gain the se-
crets for themselves or to see if the bird’s 
power may provide insight into a po-
tential Longevity Ritual Breakthrough. 
Unfortunately, the current falcon has 
been trained by a Bedouin sheikh who is 
unaware of his magnificent hawk’s value. 
The wizards may try to slay the immor-
tal hawk and then follow its aggrieved 
owner to the secret location of the nest, 
but risk the ire of the tribe’s sahirs and 
their jinn allies. Even if they defeat or 
compensate the sheikh, will the bird ac-
cept a foreigner ignorant of the Bedouin 
code of honor?

The Cradle & The Crescent
Story Flaws such as Close Family Ties, De-
pendent, Enemies, Feud, Pagan, and Oath 
of Fealty may also be appropriate for Bed-
ouin characters.
European characters who seek to gain 
such Virtues may seek out the Bedouin 
and petition for membership of a tribe. 
Foreigners that demonstrate values ad-
mired by the Bedouin may be invited into 
the clan and eligible to undergo such cer-
emonies, forging a blood kinship with a 
nomad tribe and gaining both Dutybound 
(Bedouin code) and the Close Family 
Ties (adopted Bedouin clan) Flaw. To the 
Bedouin and their jinn allies, this bond of 
clanship (‘asabiyya) supersedes all other 
loyalties. This may create difficulties for 
Hermetic magi when their adopted clan’s 
interests do not align with those of their 
covenant or the Order of Hermes as a 
whole and they are forced to sacrifice ei-
ther the Code or relations with their new 
kin. The Quaesitors may come looking for 
the transgressor, only to come face to face 
with a fully armed tribe of jinn-blooded 
Bedouin backing up the renegade, or that 
same tribe may turn up at a covenant, 
looking for vengeance.
The Najd  
and Yamama
The Najd and Yamama regions take 
the form of a high plateau that slopes 
down from the west to the east. Yamama 
is covered with a plethora of oases, mak-
ing it home to a large number of settle-
ments where the main form of subsistence 
is agriculture. The Najd is more mountain-
ous and rockier, so settlements tend to be 
found in the valleys where the inhabitants 
make use of run-off rainwater. 
The majority of the population of the 
region is nomadic Bedouin, though the 
populations of some of the urban cen-
ters are quite large. Two ancient tribes 
of Faerie jinn — the Jadis and the Tasm 
— still wander through this area and are 
known for their unusual wares, unim-
peachable honor, and offering the most 
marvelous hospitality.
Kohl
Various myths tell of the origin of 
kohl, the black or blue powder, made 
from frankincense and other spices, 
used by women all over the Mythic 
Middle East as eye makeup. Many 
attribute its origin to the jinn, as the 
powder can be readily purchased from 
the stalls of the hidden race within the 
bazaars of Golden Baghdad, although 
the price is seldom in money. In Yama-
ma, they tell a legend about a blue-
eyed witch named Zarqa al-Yamama 
who was blessed with vision so keen 
she could see a man approaching 
thirty miles in the distance. In ancient 
times when the country was still called 
Tasma and Jadis, she was killed by an 
invading Yemenite king who ordered 
his physicians to examine her eyes to 
discover the secret of her magical vi-
sion. Her eyes were found stained and 
smudged with kohl.
The most common magical kohl in 
Arabia is equivalent to a potion created 
by Bedouin folk witches, and confers the 
Minor Virtue Second Sight on a char-
acter for Sun duration when applied. 
Other formulations of kohl have been 
noted to confer differing Virtues related 
to enhanced sight: Keen Vision, Magic 
Sensitivity, Piercing Gaze, and Wilder-
ness Sense. Ability scores granted by 
magical kohl have a typical score of 2 
or 3, equal to the folk witch’s Brew Po-
tency/5 (round up) as detailed in Hedge 
Magic, pages 41–42.
Sahiras or Hermetic magi may use 
such substances for their enchantments. 
Kohl powder has a Shape and Material 
bonus of +3 to affect vision. Its main 
component is ground from charred res-
in, usually frankincense obtained from 
southern Arabia (see later).

The Cradle & The Crescent
Tayma’ and Khaybar
Tayma’, Khaybar, and the surround-
ing towns have traditionally been havens 
for Jews, and in 1220, they are indepen-
dent settlements owing allegiance to no 
sultan. The Jews make up the majority 
of the inhabitants of the area, and are 
known for being fierce and clever fight-
ers. They continue to ensure that their 
children learn the arts of war from an 
early age, and they keep their skills sharp 
with periodic forays, made in alliance 
with some of the Muslim Bedouin tribes 
of the area, against other settlements of 
the Arabian Peninsula. 
Bahrayn
The region of Bahrayn, consisting of 
both the eastern coastal territories of Ara-
bia and islands off the east coast, has had 
a checkered past. Perhaps its most notori-
ous rulers were an Isma’ili (is-ma-’EE-lee) 
Shi’i group known as the Qarmatians 
(qar-MAW-tee-anz), who reigned in the 
region from 899 to 1076. In 930 the Qa-
rmatians sacked the holy cities of Mecca 
and Medina, stealing the Black Stone from 
the Ka’ba. It was returned under mysteri-
ous circumstances in 951, left wrapped in 
a sack in the major mosque in Kufa with 
a note saying, “By command we took it, 
and by command we have brought it 
back.” The Fatimids (FAW-ti-midz), an 
Isma’ili Shi’i dynasty who ruled in North 
Africa at the time, are generally credited 
with having persuaded the Qarmatians to 
Story Seeds for the Najd and Yamama, Bahrayn, and the Empty Quarter
The Jews of  
Tayma’ and Khaybar
Fierce and cunning fighters, the Jews 
of Tayma’ and Khaybar are able rapidly 
to muster armies at times of need. Any-
one who could harness their strength 
would hence be able to assemble a formi-
dable fighting force at very short notice. 
They could therefore be useful allies if 
the characters suddenly find themselves 
facing an enemy army (such as the clas-
sic necromancer with his undead horde). 
However, traditional Judaism takes a dim 
view of magic and its practitioners, so 
the characters may have to go to consid-
erable lengths to convince the Jewish el-
ders of the region that their cause is just.
The Fate of the Black Stone
What did happen to the Black Stone 
during its sojourn in Bahrayn? Why was 
it broken? The characters find informa-
tion (perhaps revealed by a Qarmatian) 
indicating that during its absence the 
stone was stolen from the Qarmatians 
by a renegade sahirs who wished to use 
it to power a ritual of unknown nature. 
Eventually, at considerable cost in lives, 
the Qarmatians were able to slay the sor-
cerer and recover the stone, but by the 
time that they did, it had been broken 
into seven pieces. Now the supposedly 
dead sorcerer has been seen abroad once 
more, and the descendants of the survi-
vors of the original battle against him are 
gradually being murdered. The charac-
ters may be asked to protect one of the 
descendants, to hunt down the sorcerer, 
or to discover the purpose of the ritual.
The Ghosts of Hajar
A mother in Hajar misplaces her 
child, who becomes lost outside at night 
in the city. The local community of sa-
hirs suspect the ghosts are responsible 
but, being unable to control the spirits of 
the dead, directly seek outside assistance. 
Can the characters find the child before 
the ghostly soldiers do? This story could 
also become the basis for a longer saga 
arc involving laying the ghosts to rest 
and freeing Hajar and the surrounding 
regions from their curse.
The Valuable Quarter 
Due to the ease in which travelers 
can seemingly enter the Twilight Void 
and the Magic Realm, this area is some-
times known as Rub’ al-Ghali, the Valu-
able Quarter, among local sahirs and the 
few Hermetic magi who have learned of 
its existence. Potentially vast resources 
of vis and magic from the Magic Realm 
are within the grasp of even the most 
inexperienced wizard, but unfortu-
nately for the hopeful, returning to the 
mundane world does not appear to be 
as easy as leaving. Would-be explorers 
would be advised to secure some sure 
means of return or risk becoming lost in 
the eerie landscape for many lifetimes, 
perhaps even forever. Those who return 
often come back irrevocably changed 
and Warped — instances of mundane 
characters returning initiated into Sihr 
and one or more of the Solomonic Arts 
are not unheard of, but these unconven-
tionally initiated sahirs are never fully 
trusted by their fellows.
Criamon magi speculate that the 
Empty Quarter may contain a means to 
pass between this world and the Coun-
ter-Cyclical Alam. Merinita contend 
instead that the provinces of the Empty 
Quarter encircle a hidden entrance to 
Arcadia where reflections of the ancient 
deities of Arabia lie trapped — whether 
by God, Iblis, or some Magic entity. 
Perhaps both or neither are correct, but 
the joint sponsorship of a Hermetic ex-
pedition to investigate the Empty Quar-
ter has recently been agreed on and the 
two Primi are looking for young magi 
willing to investigate the rival claims. 
Some sahirs speculate that al-Hajjar and 
al-Zill, two of the early contributors 
to Solomonic Magic, may have disap-
peared into myth in this manner, and 
will one day return from their extensive 
wanderings like King Baluqiya of old, 
confirming the speculations of Islamic 
theology on magical kingdoms beyond 
the known world.

return the stone, but no-one knows for 
sure. Whatever the truth of this, the Black 
Stone was broken into seven pieces as a 
result of its travails, and it is now held to-
gether with a silver band. The Qarmatians’ 
reign ended when they were ousted by the 
Sunni Arab Uyunid dynasty, who rule the 
region in 1220, but some Qarmatians still 
live in the area.
Hajar
Hajar is the most important city in 
Bahrayn, being its major port and a link 
between Bahrayn and the coast of Persia 
on the opposite side of the gulf. However, 
its inhabitants do not go outside at night, 
for it bears the marks of a past trauma. In 
350 the Persian emperor Shapur II (r. 309–
379) ordered his forces to attack the Arab 
tribes on both sides of the gulf, slaughter-
ing, plundering, and abducting thousands 
of people in Hajar, the surrounding area, 
and the Persian coast opposite. 
Now these regions are haunted by the 
ghosts of the dead, who come out at night 
and beseech anyone they meet to help 
them against their persecutors, at least 
until they are slain by weapons wielded 
by invisible soldiers. It is said that these 
weapons can slay the living too, so the lo-
cal people remain indoors after dark, stop-
ping their ears against the screams and the 
sounds of desperate hands pounding on 
their doors.
The Empty 
Quarter
Rub’ al Khali, the Empty Quarter, is 
the particularly inhospitable tract of des-
ert that forms the border between north-
ern and southern Arabia. No caravan 
tracks have crossed it since the fall of the 
kingdom of ‘Ad in the third century and 
the loss of its trade in frankincense from 
the south — even the Bedouins skirt 
around its fringes. Several miles beyond 
the settlements in the periphery of the 
region, the dunes climb to great heights 
and the traveler enters the domain of 
al-Khali (“the Empty One”), a powerful 
elemental jinn said to stand guard over 
the lost lands of the al-Jahiliyya, the 
pre-Islamic times. 
This vast trackless expanse forms one 
of the largest and strongest Magic auras in 
the Mythic Middle East. Beyond the thou-
sand foot tall dunes that mark its periph-
ery, the aura strength rapidly increases to 
10 and the mundane terrain breaks down 
into an ever-shifting landscape of bright-
ness. Multiple regiones of bright feature-
less sand lie within its boundary, providing 
subtle traps for the unwary. Such pockets 
of space may only be entered involun-
tarily, but can be accessed with astonish-
ing ease — add 6 to the roll for entering 
a regio described in ArM5, page 189. Un-
fortunately, leaving the regiones is not as 
easy — there is a –3 penalty when trying 
to leave, making escape difficult for those 
without Second Sight, Magic Sensitivity, 
or other supernatural abilities.
Some travelers even find themselves di-
rectly transported into the mystical space 
of the Twilight Void, seemingly without 
passing through a detectable regio. By 
passing through this soft place, they find 
themselves adrift in the ageless space, 
most commonly just outside the boundary 
of one of the provinces of Auram, Imagi-
nem, or Terram. Some explorers describe 
encountering vestiges of ancient cities or 
migrating nomad tribes, or have reported 
passing through provinces aligned to oth-
er Forms. Details on the Magic Realm and 
Twilight Void are given in Realms of Power: 
Magic, pages 24–26. 
The ready access to the Magic realm 
appears to be the result of some linger-
ing effect of an ancient magical disaster 
and a ritual level power of the genius loci 
al-Khalil, while the featureless mundane 
landscape appears to magically resonate 
with the emptiness of the Void. 
The Hijaz
The Hijaz is the religious heartland of 
Islam, being home to the two holy cities of 
Mecca and Medina. As a result, it receives 
much more traffic than the rest of Arabia, 
particularly in the form of pilgrims. In ad-
dition, its position on the Red Sea makes 
it an important way station for maritime 
trade between the Mediterranean Sea and 
the Indian Ocean, and its coasts are dotted 
with harbors that provide shelter for ships 
traveling to and from Egypt, the main 
link between the two. Sahir communities 
are notably few or found only far from 
the main cities — the density of Divine 
auras and regiones makes magic difficult 
and, even without The Gift, wizards of all 
types prefer to keep a very low profile to 
avoid provoking elements of the religious 
authorities. The roads to Mecca and Me-
dina are choked with Infernal jinn, seeking 
to corrupt souls by encouraging impious 
thoughts and sowing doubt in the minds 
of pilgrims. 
Non-Muslims and  
the Holy Cities
Non-Muslims are not permitted to 
come within the harams ((HA-ramz); sing. 
haram) of the cities of Mecca and Medina, 
sacred areas extending about five miles out 
of each of the cities. This may, however, 
be problematic when designing stories 
involving the two holy cities, unless the 
entire party consists of Muslim characters. 
You may wish to adopt one of the follow-
ing approaches:
• The characters may seek to visit the 
holy cities without being discovered. 
Magic will certainly help in this re-
gard, though once the characters 
are within the cities they are likely 
to have difficulty casting spells due 
to the high Dominion auras there. 
Mundane disguises may actually be a 
better option, though the characters 
will need to be at least slightly skilled 
to avoid discovery. Needless to say, 
doing this is a grave act of sacrilege, 
and characters caught trying to sneak 
into the cities in this way will face se-
vere penalties.
• You may wish to have a smaller group, 
consisting of only Muslim characters, 
visit the city, with the other members 
of the troupe taking on the roles of 


--- Page ---

110
The Cradle & The Crescent
other Muslims whom the characters 
meet along the way.
• Alternatively, maybe a special arrange-
ment can be made if the characters are 
able to prove their need to visit the 
cities. Maybe they may visit as long as 
they are accompanied by representa-
tives of the local authorities, or maybe 
the holy sites are still off-limits to the 
non-Muslim characters, but they may 
visit the other parts of the cities freely.
• A more radical, but probably the 
easiest, solution is to assume that 
non-Muslims are allowed to visit the 
Mythic versions of the holy cities, 
with no further complications or re-
strictions involved.
Whatever approach you take, a visit to 
the holy cities, for a Muslim or a non-Mus-
lim, should be an intensely religious expe-
rience. These are, after all, cities where 
God intervened directly and frequently 
in human affairs, and such concentrated 
divine attention has left a legacy of holi-
ness that affects all who visit. As one result 
of this, the harams bear Dominion auras 
of 3, and the Dominion auras in the cit-
ies themselves are usually 4 and often even 
higher. Fighting and the taking of life (ex-
cept slaughtering animals for food or de-
struction of savage or diseased animals) is 
forbidden in the haram areas of the two 
holy cities. Unless otherwise noted, all 
Muslim Dominion auras within these ar-
eas bear a Calm Temper Trait at a score 
of +3 (see Realms of Power: The Divine, pages 
38-39). Transgressors may be struck down 
with a visible manifestation of God’s ire, 
even for minor infringements — reports of 
impious travelers provoking instances of 
the Curses Ignis Domini, Smiting of the Lord , 
or Swallowed Alive and Sent to Hell are well-
known, albeit rare (see Realms of Power: The 
Divine, page 89).
Medina
Medina, Madinat al-Nabi ((ma-DEE-
nat un-NA-bee), “the City of the Proph-
et”), is the second holy city of Islam and 
is situated on a flat plain cradled between 
several mountains and ancient lava flows, 
the junction of a number of valleys and 
passes through the mountains. The soil 
is unusually fertile, and a variety of fruits 
and cereals are grown here. The city is 
surrounded by strong walls with watch-
towers built by the sultan of Syria, Nur 
al-Din (r. 1146–1174), in 1162. The 
governor currently owes allegiance to 
the sultan of Egypt, although the city 
is largely left to run its own affairs. The 
city has traditionally been home to a 
large number of religious scholars; the 
famous jurist Malik ibn Anas (d. 795), 
who founded the major Sunni school of 
law that became known as the school of 
the Malikis ((MEH-li-keez), “the follow-
ers of Malik”), is one of those who lived 
and worked here. 
Dominion auras in Medina are one 
point higher than they would be else-
where, and the city is the site of numer-
ous mosques, shrines, and other histori-
cal sites.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Mecca
The holy city of Mecca lies in a val-
ley between several mountains, sheltered 
from the winds and heat of the wilderness. 
The city contains both urban dwellings 
and a multitude of shrines, convents, re-
ligious colleges, and especially mosques, 
of which there are 100. At its center lies 
the greatest of these, the Haram Mosque, 
within which is the Ka’ba. As indicated 
earlier, the Arabic term haram indicates 
the inviolable sacred areas surrounding 
and including Mecca and Medina (see 
Non-Muslims and the Holy Cities, ear-
lier), but it is also used to indicate the 
Haram Mosque specifically. The divine 
influence on Mecca is clear: the climate 
is supernaturally mild, vegetation grows 
lush but never wild, and a sense of peace 
pervades the streets. As in Medina, all 
Dominion auras in the city are one point 
higher than they would be normally.
Mecca is always densely populated. In 
addition to the townsfolk who serve the 
city’s needs, many religious scholars live 
and work in the Haram Mosque and the 
other religious buildings here. In addition, 
the city sees constant traffic as pilgrims 
arrive, stay for periods ranging from a 
couple of weeks to a few years, then move 
on again. The majority of the people who 
live in Mecca are Sunnis, but there are also 
a large number of Zaydi (ZAY-dee) Shi’is 
here. Pilgrims come from almost all Mus-
lim denominations. 
The city is ruled by a governor known 
as the Grand Sharif (sha-REEF), a descen-
dent of the Prophet through his grandson 
al-Hasan and a member of the Hawashim 
clan; the current Grand Sharif is Qatada 
Story Seeds for the Holy Cities
The Lava Flows of Medina
The lava flows around Medina cooled 
and hardened centuries ago, but occa-
sional earthquakes open cracks in them, 
allowing fresh lava to flow out. The char-
acters learn that the earthquakes are not 
a natural phenomenon, but are instead 
the results of experiments by forces hos-
tile to Medina who is attempting to re-
liquify the lava flows all around the city. 
Will they be able to stop them before 
they achieve this and drown the holy 
city in molten lava?
The Lost Lords of Mecca
The Jurhumites are an ancient tribe 
of jann-blooded Bedouin who once ruled 
Mecca and areas of the Hijaz. They re-
jected Islam and appeared to be defeated 
by the early armies but now live on with-
in old tales about the pre-Islamic tribes of 
Arabia. The whole tribe now consists of 
Faerie jann, although a few jinn-blooded 
sahirs are secretly considered adopted 
members of their clan. They are best 
represented as dark Faerie Jinn and play 
roles in stories about crises of faith or 
dishonor and tend to have more elemen-
tal magic (specifically Auram and Terram 
powers) at their disposal than their usual 
Faerie cousins (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). 
As former inhabitants of Mecca, Jurhu-
mites are potential guides for non-Mus-
lims attempting to infiltrate the holy cit-
ies for subterfuge or war, being privy to 
secret ways into the closed areas. 
The Jurhumite sahir might seek out 
Hermetic magi to aid them in their feud 
against the current regime. Are the Ju-
rhumites behind the change in the lava 
flows around Medina, or are they merely 
being used as scapegoats by a opportu-
nistic group of renegade sahir? 
The Restoring  
Waters of Zamzam
On the night after the end of Ra-
madan, the Divine aura in the Well of 
Zamzam at Meca’s Haram mosque dips 
slightly and the water in the well can be 
harvested by moonlight as an unusual 
form of Extraordinary Aquam Vis. Each 
mouthful of water is able to restore all of 
a character’s lost Fatigue Levels through 
an unknown ritual level non-Hermetic 
effect. Hermetic magi may be tempted 
to obtain such a remarkable substance, 
whether for personal use or as a potential 
source of Insight into overcoming the 
Hermetic Limit of Energy.
The Marid of the Well
Unknown to most of the pilgrims, the 
eponymous Zamzam — an ancient Mag-
ic marid — lies trapped in a suppressed 
Magic regio at the base of the Well of 
Zamzam at Mecca’s Haram mosque, its 
powers overcome by the overwhelming 
Divine aura. The spirit’s remaining magi-
cal power preserves the well’s amazingly 
pure water but it has come to resent its 
imprisonment by the Dominion. 
Ancient beyond belief, the Zamzam 
marid may also have knowledge of the 
past useful to the characters that cannot 
be gained from any other source, but 
how can one discreetly communicate 
with such an entity within the most holy 
shrine of Islam? If freed, what would its 
actions be and how would the Muslim 
authorities react to such desecration of 
the ancient spring?
The Mosque of the Jinn
A magus of House Merinita hires the 
characters to conduct an investigation 
into the Mosque of the Jinn at Mecca, 
demanding that they provide an exten-
sive report on its denizens and visitors in 
the hope of understanding how and why 
such Faerie creatures seemingly ape the 
worship of the Dominion without pro-
ducing a Divine aura. 
The normally hospitable Jinn become 
considerably less enthusiastic when it 
becomes apparent that the characters are 
there to observe, rather than take part in 
Muslim worship, since it is from human 
participation in the latter that the jinn 
derive vitality. Many of the jinn object 
to being treated like lab specimens. How 
can the characters resolve this situation 
without upsetting either their hosts or 
their employer?

The Cradle & The Crescent
(r. 1201–1220). If your saga follows his-
tory, in 1220, Qatada, along with many 
other members of his family, is killed 
when his son al-Hasan carries out a mas-
sacre to ensure his succession. However, 
the Ayyubid sultan of Yemen, al-Mas’ud 
Yusuf, steps in to quell the chaos and 
imposes military rule. The Grand Sharifs 
only regain control after the sultan’s death 
in 1229.
The Haram Mosque  
and the Ka’ba
The Haram Mosque is the most sa-
cred of mosques, the building that holds 
the Ka’ba, the shrine built by Adam under 
the guidance of angels, and subsequently 
rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. 
It takes the form of a rectangular court-
yard, around which are highly-decorated 
open halls supported by multiple rows 
of columns. Off the northwest hall is the 
Dar al-Nadwa (DAHR un-NAD-wa), a 
building constructed around a second 
hall, where consultation is carried out be-
tween religious scholars and the Grand 
Sharif. Off the southwest hall is a build-
ing used by scholars of the Maliki legal 
school. The mosque has twenty gates and 
seven minarets. The Dominion aura here 
is overwhelming, with a score of 10. Mus-
lim characters may invoke baraka here to 
request any of the Saint Powers listed in 
Realms of Power: The Divine, pages 88–89; if 
required, the site counts as having Divine 
Might of 100.
The Ka’ba itself takes the form of 
a cuboid shrine, about 40 feet on each 
side and 46 feet tall. Although it is richly 
decorated, the upper parts of the walls 
are generally kept mostly covered with a 
green drapery known as the kiswa (KIS-
wa). Implanted into the wall at the eastern 
corner, about five feet from the ground, 
is the Black Stone, said to have been cast 
from Heaven to show Adam and Eve 
where to build the Ka’ba. According to 
tradition, the stone was originally white 
but turned black as it absorbed sins over 
the centuries. Muslim pilgrims attempt to 
touch or kiss the stone to gain forgiveness 
for their sins. 
The Ka’ba may be entered through 
a door on the northeast wall, which is 
about seven feet above ground level and 
reached by a wheeled set of wooden 
steps that is pushed up to the door when 
it is opened. The inside is richly deco-
rated with slabs of marble of many col-
ors, and normally one finds within three 
columns that support the roof, a stair-
case leading to the roof, and a variety 
of Muslim artifacts and relics, including 
several ancient and valuable copies of the 
Qur’an and documents on the walls that 
record the activities of those who reno-
vated the Ka’ba. The exception is on days 
when the Ka’ba is opened to the public, 
which is most Mondays and Fridays, for 
on those days pious Muslims who enter 
the Ka’ba find themselves in a terrestrial 
divine regio, still at aura level 10, which 
represents an even more richly decorated 
version of the Ka’ba and has the distinc-
tive feature of being able to accommo-
date more people than could normally fit 
inside the building. 
Muslims in the Ka’ba usually seek to 
pray at the place where the Prophet used 
to pray, about five feet from the southwest 
wall, and at such times, miraculously, they 
may all pray in the same place without 
crowding each other. Whether the regio is 
accessible or not, Muslims may seek to in-
voke baraka from Muhammad both inside 
and just outside the Ka’ba.
Within the courtyard of the Haram 
mosque also lies the marble domed Well 
of Zamzam, about 20 yards east of the 
Ka’ba. Revealed to Ibrahim’s wife Hajar 
when she was searching for water for her 
thirsty son Ishmael, the well is older than 
the first buildings of Mecca. The waters 
are clean and pure but although they are 
drunk by many Muslim pilgrims as part of 
their devotion, they do not usually have 
any supernatural properties. 
Al-Ma’la Cemetery and  
the Mosque of the Jinn
Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed 
unto me that a company of the Jinn gave 
ear, and they said: Lo! We have heard a 
marvelous Qur’an,
Which guideth unto righteousness, so 
we believe in it and we ascribe no partner 
unto our Lord.
And (we believe) that He exalted be 
the glory of our Lord hath taken neither 
wife nor son,
And that the foolish one among us 
used to speak concerning Allah an atro-
cious lie.
	
	
— The Qur’an 72: 1-4
On the northern edge of Mecca is the 
cemetery of al-Ma’la, where many of the 
Prophet’s family members and followers 
are buried, including Amina, his mother; 
Khadija, his first wife; and ‘Abd al-Muttal-
ib, his grandfather. Near the cemetery is a 
mosque known as the Mosque of the Jinn, 
where a group of jinn heard the Prophet 
reciting the Qur’an and were thereby per-
suaded to convert to Islam. 
The mosque has since become the ap-
parent center of jinn worship of God, and 
they continue to gather publicly at this 
place, so that at prayer times, and espe-
cially at the Friday noon prayer, it bustles 
with Faerie jinn of all manner of shapes 
and sizes. Even the mosque officials are 
undisguised jinn.
Unspoken convention requires that 
all jinn attending prayers avoid assuming 
forms that are too monstrous or so large as 
The Hajj
The hajj is one of the five “Pillars of 
Islam,” five practices that mark some-
one as being a Muslim. All Muslims 
are obliged to perform the hajj at least 
once during their lifetime, if at all pos-
sible. For most who undertake it, it is a 
life-changing event, often leading them 
to abandon inappropriate practices and 
make a new start in life.
Details of the hajj are presented in 
Realms of Power: The Divine, page 108.
A Muslim who has completed the hajj 
gains a Personality Trait of Pious +3. The 
Muslim also gains 3 Faith Points. It is pos-
sible to undertake the hajj again to regain 
the Personality Trait and Faith Points, but 
repeated performance of the hajj will nev-
er raise the Personality Trait above +3.

to take up too much space in the mosque. 
A few humans also attend prayers at the 
mosque, interacting freely with its super-
natural inhabitants. Respectful mortals, 
including sahirs and other wizards, are 
always welcomed, if sometimes a bit over-
enthusiastically. The mosque has a Faerie 
Aura of 4 which rises to 5 when the jinn 
are attending prayers.
Ta’if
About 60 miles to the southeast of 
Mecca, built on the mountain slopes, lies 
the town of Ta’if. Before the rise of Islam, 
Ta’if was the site of a major idol to the 
Arabian goddess al-Lat, goddess of fertil-
ity and patron of shepherds and caravan 
travelers, but after the Muslim conquest 
of the city in 631 this idol was destroyed. 
Ta’if is well-known for its orchards, and it 
supplies fruit to many other towns of the 
region, including Mecca.
The Cult of the  
Daughters of Allah
Al-Lat was one of three major god-
desses worshiped in the local area, the 
other two being al-Manat, goddess of for-
tune and destiny, whose cult was based at 
a place called al-Qudayd, at an unknown 
location about ten miles from Medina, and 
al-’Uzza, goddess of strength and the plan-
et Venus, who was worshiped at a sanctu-
ary on the outskirts of Mecca. These three 
goddesses were known as the “Daughters 
of Allah.” Even before the rise of Islam, 
Allah was worshiped by the pagans as a 
supreme creator god, and these Daughters 
are connected with a story known as that 
of the “Satanic Verses,” which by 1220 has 
been circulating for centuries among Mus-
lim scholars. 
According to this story, at one point 
during the Prophet’s lifetime, the Qur’anic 
revelation allegedly was somehow adul-
terated by Iblis, who managed to achieve 
the temporary insertion into the text of 
verses that permitted the Muslims to ask 
the Daughters of Allah to intercede with 
Him on their behalf. According to the 
story, this was immediately corrected by 
God, who revealed to His Prophet verses 
that rejected such a role for the goddesses. 
Whether this incident actually happened 
remains a matter of debate among Muslim 
scholars of the 13th century.
In Mythic Arabia, Ta’if is home to the 
Cult of the Daughters of Allah, a fam-
ily-based cult that has secretly kept the 
worship of the Daughters of Allah alive 
throughout the centuries. At any given 
point in time, there are three members 
of the family, each of whom can channel 
the power of one of the three deities. The 
family’s ultimate objective is to restore the 
worship of the Daughters of Allah, but 
first they need to find the sanctuaries of 
all three goddesses; they have found the 
sanctuaries of al-Lat and al-’Uzza, and 
now they are in the process of seeking 
out al-Qudayd and the lost sanctuary of 
al-Manat. The current family consists of a

man named ‘Abd al-Qadir, his son Yusuf, 
and Yusuf’s wife Farida.
Depending on how you wish to depict 
the cult in your saga, you may choose to 
generate the members of the cult using the 
rules for Spirit Votaries (Realms of Power: 
Magic, pages 88–89); alternatively, it may 
be that the cult is infernally corrupted, in 
which case the rules for Diabolists may be 
more suitable (Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
pages 101–113). 
‘Abd al-Qadir, as the representative of 
al-Lat, has powers over fertility and travel, 
including the ability to control the growth 
of humans, animals and plants, and travel 
supernaturally swiftly from one place to 
the next. Yusuf, as the representative of al-
Manat, can affect probabilities, affecting 
players’ die rolls, and Farida, as the rep-
resentative of al-’Uzza, is supernaturally 
strong and also has powers over Venus’ 
traditional realms of beauty, romance, the 
performing arts and communication.
‘Asir & Yemen
To the south of the Hijaz lie the prov-
inces of ‘Asir and Yemen, controlled by the 
Ayyubid sultan of Yemen. The majority of 
the population are either Sunnis or Zaydi 
Shi’is, although in Yemen there are also 
scattered communities of Tayyibis (TOY-
yi-beez), an offshoot of the Isma’ili Shi’i 
Fatimids who maintain the belief in a hid-
den dynasty of imams. The Tayyibis are 
heavily involved in trade and have regular 
contact with the island of Soqotra to the 
south, home to a strange culture of non-
Hermetic sorcerers (See Rival Magic, pages 
110–141, for more details on Soqotran 
Sorcerers). As a result of their seafaring, 
the Yemenites are even beginning to ex-
pand into the old Ethiopian lands in Africa 
and across the Arabian Sea into al-Sind.
Sana’a
Located in the highlands of Yemen, 
where the air is fresh and the temperature 
cool, the city of Sana’a is the administrative 
center of the Yemen-’Asir region, home to 
Arab Poetry
Poetry has an important place in 
Bedouin culture, the earliest examples 
dating from before the rise of Islam. 
Thepoet (shai’ir ; not to be confused 
with sahir) and the reciter (rawi) hold a 
position combining elements of histo-
rian, soothsayer, and panegyrist. Verses 
in praise of the tribe or sheikh, known 
as qit’ah, and scathing attacks on the vir-
tue of other tribes, referred to as hija’, 
form the bulk of the works transmit-
ted through oral tradition. Zajal, mock 
battles in verse, remain popular as a way 
of resolving hostilities between Bedouin 
sahirs. This is mechanically an opposed 
roll of Communication + Solomonic 
Storytelling for sahirs, or Communica-
tion and Folk Ken for battles between 
mundanes, but characters with an Ara-
bic score of 6 or greater gain a +2 to 
their total.
Poetry and storytelling remain an 
integral part of Arab life in the 13th cen-
tury and it is thought that exceptional 
performances may produce wondrous 
effects. The Art of Memory, valued by 
Islamic scholars for reciting the Qur’an, 
is believed to have originated among 
the pagan poets. Enchanting Poetry and 
Entrancement are common among Bed-
ouin poets, even among non-wizards, 
and the former is the most commonly 
initiated Major Supernatural Virtue 
gained through devotion to muru’a. 
A fabled example is the irascible sati-
rist, Abu Nuwas, a poet sponsored at the 
legendary court of Harun al-Raschid, 
who passed into the myth and legend 
of Golden Baghdad as a Faerie creature 
of Elysium, living within the tales of The 
Thousand and One Nights.
Story Seed:  
Poets and Qareen 
‘Abqari, contemporary poets blessed 
with an artistic qareen, can be created 
using the rules for Legendary Artists or 
Maestro Mythic Companions (see Art 
& Academe, pages 133–135). The qareen 
of such characters are best reflected 
by the Faerie Friend, Magical (Being) 
Companion, or Impious Friend Minor 
Flaws, depending on the Realm affilia-
tion of the artist. Many ‘abqari possess 
Enchanting Poetry and the Muse Minor 
Supernatural Virtues (Houses of Hermes: 
Societates, page 56). Some of these poets 
are granted such power over words that 
they may mimic the Folk Witch power 
of Cursing or the Gruagach Arts of Give, 
Blessing, and Curse, reflecting their abil-
ity to lampoon and satirize opponents 
into misfortune through their verse (see 
Hedge Magic Revised Edition for details of 
these non-Hermetic powers).
Journeying to ‘Aqbar may compose 
part of an Initiation Script for a mem-
ber of the Merinita “Keepers of Tales” 
Mystery Cult, or be of interest to Jer-
biton magi or artistic Redcaps passion-

Story Seed:  
The Poetry Festival at ‘Ukaz
Once a year the small oasis town of 
‘Ukaz, situated halfway between Mecca 
and Medina, holds a poetry competi-
tion, a tradition dating back to ancient 
times. The seven great poems known as 
the Mu’allaqat (“the Suspended Odes”) 
that now grace the walls of the Ka’ba 
had their origin in this fair. Today, the 
winner’s prize varies from year to year 
as the sponsorship of the fair passes 
from one tribe of jinn to another. The 
prize is always something of great val-
ue — one year, the jinn may reward a 
winner with the secret path to ‘Abqar, 
another year they may bestow kinship 
with their tribe for eternity, and yet an-
other they may offer the service of one 
of their younger jinn as an uncondi-
tional servant. Depending on the prize, 
magi and sahirs may be drawn to the 
festival, hoping to gain something oth-
erwise impossible to acquire — some-
thing vital to their plans. Competition 
is always fierce, but the poetry is always 
breathtakingly beautiful.

the Ayyubid sultan al-Mas’ud Yusuf. It is 
renowned for its market, the Suq al-Milh 
(Salt Market), where all sorts of oddities 
may be found by the persistent, and for 
the quality of its food.
The Valley of ‘Abqar
In Al-Jahiliyya, the pre-Islamic times, 
jinn were said to dwell in the Valley of 
‘Abqar and inspire the greatest of the old 
Arabian bards and poets, acting as their Su-
pernatural Muses. The valley may be a faerie 
regio accessed from both Yemen or south-
ern Jordan, a city or town within Arcadia, or 
perhaps all of these simultaneously.

To the east of Sana’a lie the remains 
of Ma’rib, the ancient capital of Balqis (or 
Bilqis), the Queen of Sheba. It was once 
ruled by mukkaribs, hereditary priest-kings 
Story Seed: Farida’s Fears
The cult of the Daughters of Allah 
discovers the location of the sanctuary 
of al-Manat and begins a tripartite ritual 
that is intended to bring about apoca-
lyptic results, possibly restoring the 
goddesses to the mortal realm, or dam-
aging or destroying the Ka’ba at Mecca. 
The player characters get wind of this 
and must take action to stop them.
Farida, as the newest member of 
the family, has qualms about her in-
volvement in the cult. Perhaps she feels 
strongly connected to her Muslim up-
bringing, which is leading her to have 
second thoughts. Maybe she is being 
asked to engage in practices that she 
finds conflict with her own morals. 
More sinisterly, perhaps she is pregnant, 
and she has been told by her father-in-
law that she will be giving birth to her 
replacement, making her concerned for 
her future in a family that is normally 
limited to only three members. Will the 
characters be able to help her?
Suleiman and the Queen of Sheba
Suleiman heard from the hoopoe (a 
brightly-colored bird fond of traveling 
widely) of the Queen of Sheba’s king-
dom, a land where the people worshiped 
the sun alongside God, and so he decided 
to invite Balqis to discuss her faith with 
him. She accepted his invitation and pre-
pared riddles and difficult questions with 
which to test him. Then she set out to 
Jerusalem in a caravan laden with gold, 
spices, and precious jewels.
Suleiman, in the meantime, asked his 
court if anyone could bring the queen’s 
throne before she arrived. A jinni boast-
ed that it could obtain it before Sulei-
man rose from his seat, but “one who 
had knowledge of the Book” promised 
to bring it in the blink of an eye. The 
throne thus procured, it was disguised to 
test whether Balqis was a recipient of di-
vine guidance. When she entered Sulei-
man’s throne room she remarked on how 
much the throne resembled her own, but 
then when she entered a hall paved with 
glass she mistook it for a lake, drawing 
up her skirts and baring her legs. When 
her folly was revealed, she recognized 
that her worship of the sun was also in-
correct and acknowledged God as the 
only deity.
Story Seed: King Suleiman 
and the Queen of Sheba
Remains of Sheba’s sun worship might 
still be present in Ma’rib or other sites 
across the Middle East — the actual dei-
ties that the people of Sheba worshiped 
might be in reality either powerful Faerie 
entities, who crave worship from humans 
and plot to achieve this, or demons who 
represent themselves as a heavenly trin-
ity, seeking to turn people away from 
worship of the True God. Was the magic 
of the mukkaribs a variant of the more 
common summoning arts — instead of 
calling jinn, could it command and con-
trol celestial entities and Astra Planeta 
Daimons in a way similar to the Theurgi-
cal Mysteries? 
Characters might encounter the 
hoopoe or its descendents, magical crea-
tures who might be guides through the 
region or even prove suitable as familiars 
or magical covenfolk. Also, what became 
of the queen’s throne and the hall paved 
with glass? Perhaps they are supernatural 
or even Divine items that remain some-
where, waiting to be rediscovered.
In addition, what became of Sulei-
man and the Queen of Sheba? Accord-
ing to tradition, they both died, but they 
were powerful sorcerers. Could they still 
be alive, perhaps working behind the 
scenes to influence human events? Per-
haps the Queen’s skills at entrancement 
and political magic has secretly left a 
legacy within the Storytelling magic of 
current sahirs, a legacy that may hint at 
further mysteries yet to be incorporated 
into the Solomonic Arts? 
Story Seed: The Food of Sana’a
Why is the food in Sana’a so uni-
versally good? The characters gain pos-
session of a cooking vessel from Sana’a 
and discover that it bears a hedge magic 
enchantment that makes meals unusu-
ally tasty, but that also Warps those who 
use the vessel over an extended period 
of time. If such cooking vessels are in 
widespread use, then the entire popula-
tion of the town may be suffering from 
Warping effects unawares. Who created 
these vessels, and do they know of the 
damage that they are causing the people 
of Sana’a?

The Cradle & The Crescent
of celestial deities representing the sun, 
moon, and stars: al-Shams, ‘Ilmaqa, and 
al-Zuhara.
Most of the palaces, temples, and 
gardens lie in ruins now, but the great 
jinn-built temple of Ghumdam remains, 
standing in solitary silence and bearing 
a Magic aura of 6, although smaller less 
powerful auras are scattered throughout 
the city, home to pagan jinn that once 
served the Queen at the bequest of King 
Suleiman. The great dyke that once held 
back the waters of the Wadi Udhana, pro-
tecting the city from the depredations of 
the uncontrollable water elementals that 
plague the river upstream, lies broken in 
the high mountains.
The lands around here could be a 
good spot upon which to found a cov-
enant, if the characters could overcome 
the difficulties of supplying such a re-
mote site and the hostile supernatural 
inhabitants, who bear no love for wizards 
or summoners.
Hadramawt
Hadramawt is a relative backwater 
in the Muslim world. Its valleys contain 
few sources of water and are only sparse-
ly populated, while the hills, though at 
some points heavily forested, are too 
steep to make agriculture or coppicing 
viable means of subsistence. Very few 
pilgrims or other travelers make it this 
far south, and the people tend to be sur-
prised when they encounter strangers. It 
is remarkable only for the unusual crea-
ture known as the nisnas (nis-NEHS) and 
being the source of many of the resins 
and spices traded throughout the Mythic 
Middle East passing along the coast to 
Mythic Europe.
Like other distant areas of the Mythic 
Middle East, its isolation may make it ap-
pealing as a potential site for initial Her-
metic settlement, because the magical re-
sources of the wilderness and the various 
Magic jinn aligned to its natural features 
are relatively unknown to all but a hand-
ful of itinerant sahirs. The extreme lack 
of mundane resources, sparse population, 
and its distance from larger settlements 
will require magical solutions for the cov-
enant to prosper.
Frankincense and Myrrh
Both these resinous materials are ob-
tained from gnarled trees that grow pre-
dominantly in the fog-wrapped mountains 
of Hadramawt, although groves can be 
found in parts of Oman, Ethiopia, and on 
the isolated island of Soqotra. Harvest-
ers tap the trees, making small incisions 
that allow the milky sap to exude slowly 
and then harden into “tears” of sticky 
resin over three months. The two resins 
form the main ingredients of incense used 
throughout the Mythic Middle East and

The nisnas is found in the forests of 
Yemen and Hadramawt, though its ori-
gin seems to be in Hadramawt specifi-
cally. It is a wild, inoffensive creature, 
but the people of Hadramawt find its 
flesh sweet, so they hunt it for food. 
Nisnases can speak, and tales are told 
of some who begged for mercy before 
they were slain.
Story Seed:  
An Escaped Nisnas
The characters come across a nis-
nas that has escaped from its captors. It 
begs them to help it get away. This is 
likely to raise a moral or emotional di-
lemma for some characters. According 
to most religious teachings, only hu-
mans have souls. Yet this creature seems 
literally half-human; so does it have a 
soul? Even if not, will the characters 
willingly refuse aid to a creature that is 
begging for them to help it escape from 
being eaten?

The Cradle & The Crescent
Mythic Europe. Myrrh was traditionally 
more expensive in ancient Rome, although 
frankincense has always been more popu-
lar, and each is worth more than its weight 
in gold when traded.
The resin trees are found on the more 
inaccessible wooded slopes of the area 
and guarded by flying serpents known as 
syrenii (or iaculii). These mundane guard-
ians must be driven off by harvesters 
with smoke created by burning a similar 
resinous reagent imported from Anatolia 
known as storax.
Frankincense, literally “incense of the 
French,” comes from the stunted and har-
dy mogar tree. It is commonly referred to 
as olibanum (al-lubban, “that which results 
from milking”). It is a light yellow resin, 
often tinted with green, known for its me-
dicinal qualities, in particular its ability to 
quicken the blood. The quality of the res-
in depends on the exact climatic and soil 
conditions, with each tree having a specific 
time when it produces its best resin. When 
burned, it gives off a slightly balsamic and 
lemony fragrance characteristic of incense. 
The charred resin is one of the main com-
ponents of the eye-powder referred to as 
kohl (see earlier). Frankincense resin has 
the following Shape & Material bonuses: 
+3 medicine, +5 promote life.
Myrrh, in contrast, is a reddish-brown 
resin, with the best quality specimens be-
ing both darker and more translucent than 
inferior examples. It has a sharp pleasant 
scent and when burned gives off a heavy, 
acrid smoke with a hint of vanilla. Apart 
from its use in incense, it is used as an ad-
ditive in wine, for embalming ointment, 
and in the holy oil used by the Eastern 
Orthodox Church. Myrrh has the follow-
ing Shape & Material bonuses: +3 relieve 
arthritis or inflammation, +5 preservation, 
+2 sanctify.
Flying Serpent (Iaculus)
The flying serpents known to Pliny 
as syrenii are found in great numbers in 
southern Arabia and on the island of So-
qotra to the far south of Yemen (see Rival 
Magic, page 110). The Arabian snakes are 
typically white in coloration with bat-
like wings, and an individual syrenus may 
sport a pair of short legs. These snakes 
perch in the incense trees of Hadramawt 
and are known for their darting attack, 
leaping out of trees onto passing prey. 
Flocks of syrenii attempt to migrate into 
Egypt each year, only to be destroyed by 
their natural enemies, the ibises. 
Hermetic magi refer to these snakes 
as iaculii, but most mundanes call them 
“javelin-snakes” or “darters” due to their 
unusually rapid and lethal method of at-
tack. As the ibis is linked to Thoth and 
therefore Hermes, most Hermetic magi 
consider an iaculus an ill-omened crea-
ture, but at least one Quaesitor uses them 
as aids to his investigations. Exceptional 
syrenii are believed to have additional 
powers allowing them to ignore wards 
and other protection magic in order to 
deliver their venom, but these claims 
have yet to be investigated by Hermetic 
magi. Their exact relationship to the 
magical Olibanum Serpents of Soqotra 
is unclear but the Arabian serpents are 
much less sociable than their kin and 
appear resistant to being tamed short of 
magical means. It is not known wheth-
er the syrenii originated on Soqotra or 
the more aggressive variety represents a 
more primitive species that was then im-
ported from the mainland.
Syrenii use the base statistics for Ad-
ders listed in The Book of Mundane Beasts or 
Realms of Power: Magic, page 141, modified 
as follows: increase Quickness to +4; gain 
ability to fly; add Ferocity (when leap-
ing) and Improved Characteristics Vir-
tues; add the Fast Flyer and Good Jumper 
Qualities; add Athletics 4 (jumping). Any 
character who makes a Intelligence + 
Magic Lore or Intelligence + Arabia Lore 
roll against an Ease Factor of 9 will recall 
that these creatures can be scattered by 
burning the resin of the storax tree.

ing. In the end God sent a great storm 
to destroy them, with the exception of 
Hud and the few who accepted his mes-
sage. The storm drove the city deep into 
the sands. There it lies still, waiting to be 
discovered by explorers. 
The great depression in the sands 
above the surface of the city has a Magic 
aura of 5, hinting at the greater riches 
beneath.
‘Uman
Located at the eastern end of the Ara-
bian Peninsula, ‘Uman’s interior is mostly 
hot and dry desert, while the coastal 
mountains and plains are cooler and 
more fertile, supporting agriculture. The 
province also forms a channel for trade 
between Arabia and the Indian Ocean, 
which is conducted via various ports on 
its coasts. The majority of the population 
of ‘Uman follow a variant form of Islam 
called Ibadism.
Hadramawt and ‘Uman Story Seeds
The Trees That Cry Blood
In the seaside hills of Hadramawt is 
a grove of five ancient mogar trees that 
seem to grow directly from the rock, 
resisting even the thrashings of the 
seasonal monsoons of the Erythraean 
Sea. The resin produced from these 
trees, when harvested during a violent 
storm, yields unusually pure frankin-
cense tears that each contain a single 
pawn of dedicated Rego Terram vis — 
each tree produces several pawns of vis 
per harvest. The timing of the harvest 
storms is complex, but well-known to 
the local inhabitants, who are terrified 
of the particularly large and aggressive 
population of syrenii nestled among the 
branches of the grove. Harvesting the 
vis is no easy undertaking, as the ser-
pents seem immune to the usual storax 
smoke and standard wards appear to 
have little effect. 
Even if successfully harvested, the 
existence of the trees becomes read-
ily known to another magical group, 
whether they be rival Hermetic explor-
ers, local hedge wizards or sahirs repre-
senting the Order of Suleiman. Perhaps 
renegade members of the Olibanum 
tribe of the normally isolationist Soqo-
trans are interested in the unusual resin 
produced (see Rival Magic for details on 
these non-Hermetic wizards). Contin-
ued supernatural disturbance and in-
tense magical activity or botches in the 
grove may awaken the trees, providing 
another obstacle to harvesting as the 
animated bushes gain the ability to ac-
tively resist interlopers with their spiny 
arms. Are the tears of the trees worth 
the price in blood?
Discovering the Lost City
There are a number of ways that 
characters might come across this lost 
city. They might come across a map in-
dicating its location; they might be ap-
proached by a descendent of one of the 
survivors of the destruction who wishes 
to recover something from the city; or 
they might come across it purely by ac-
cident, finding a tunnel into the earth or 
even reaching it after falling victim to a 
patch of dry quicksand.
However they find it, visitors to the 
city find it intact in a great cavern under 
the desert, still filled with the riches of 
its inhabitants, along with their desic-
cated corpses, and the Magic auras here 
remain strong. Indeed, this makes it an 
attractive site for a new covenant. The 
major difficulty is navigating the city, 
for its inhabitants were about 12 yards 
in height and hence everything is built 
on a much larger scale than it would be 
for normal humans.
The discovery of the ancient city 
may draw the attention of the remain-
ing Giants of ‘Ad, itinerant stonesmiths 
renown for their building skills. Will the 
giants look favorably upon the discov-
erers or will they try and prevent the 
city from disclosing its ancient secrets 
and treasures?
The Witches of Nizwa
Perhaps the witches of Nizwa are 
a movement of Infernalists or Faerie 
wizards who become the arch-enemies 
of the characters. Banished Soqotran 
witches may have formed a secret 
community in exile, or the group may 
be agents of the Olibanum King trying 
to discredit and destabilize the Order 
of Suleiman (see Rival Magic, pages 
110–141). The group may even be the 
last remnant of a tradition of sorcer-
esses privy to the astral magic of an-
cient Sheba. 
Alternatively, the rumors may be 
utterly unfounded, which has interest-
ing implications if the characters have 
found an attractive site for a covenant 
near the city, leading to stories, or even 
a complete saga, based on the theme of 
overcoming negative preconceptions 
and stereotypes.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Muscat
Perhaps the same as the Crypto Portus 
(“Hidden Port”) of Ptolemy or the Moscha 
of Pliny, this coastal town is a prominent 
trade point for voyages traveling beyond 
the Mythic Middle East. Many voyagers 
dreaming of wealth depart, never to re-
turn, from its quays. Recently conquered 
from the Abbasids by the local Yahmad 
tribe, the city is looking to expand trade 
further eastwards. It is the home of a large 
group of sahirs specializing in the Solo-
monic Art of Travel, who have founded 
a bayt al-hikma dedicated to discovering 
the legendary islands encountered in the 
tales by Sinbad the Sailor. 
Nizwa
Nizwa is the royal city of ‘Uman, 
home to the local Nabhanid kings and 
a center of religion, trade and art. It has 
numerous beautifully decorated mosques 
and palaces, as well as bustling markets 
that are particularly famous for their silver 
jewelry and finely crafted daggers. Several 
buyut of sahirs are found within the city 
and its hinterlands.
However, Nizwa also has a darker 
side, reputed to be the home of witches 
and sorcerers. Among the deeds as-
cribed to these are instantaneous travel, 
achieved by crossing a line drawn in the 
sand to appear at another location, and, 
more sinisterly, turning people into mind-
less slaves by making them appear to die, 
then taking their “corpses” and control-
ling them.
Giant of ‘Ad
Descendants of Great ‘Ad, the giants 
of southern Arabia are colossal magical 
creatures from pre-Islamic times. De-
scended from Noah’s third son, they 
have dwelled within magic regiones 
deep within the deserts of Oman since 
the loss of their greatest creation, the 
fabled City of a Thousand Pillars. Un-
like many magical creatures, the ‘Adites 
are not immortal and weaken if they 
spend too much time outside strong 
desert Magic auras.

more civilized than the primitive 
giants of Europe. They have an af-
finity for falcons and other birds of 
prey and are usually found accom-
panied by at least one nesting with-
in their long hair or beard. Lone gi-
ants emerge from the deep desert to 
offer their building skills to sorcer-
ers and emirs, in return for insights 
into the secrets of eternal life. 
A giant of ‘Ad is balanced as a 
starting character, albeit a powerful 
initial Companion option. This char-
acter guide has 295 Experience Points 
available to spend on Abilities and 5 
Virtue points free (to be balanced with 
5 points of Flaws). His falcon compan-
ion may be either mundane or magi-
cal, although proportionately larger 
(up to Size +3) and has its statistics 
adjusted accordingly.

This chapter covers the political cen-
ter and northwest provinces of the Sunni 
Muslim world, most of the rulers of which 
proclaim at least nominal allegiance to the 
‘Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. However, in 
most areas provincial governors reign as 
independent rulers, only seeking approval 
from the caliph when it helps to bolster 
their claims to legitimacy.
The terrain of this region is divided 
broadly into three zones. In Iraq and 
much of the Jazira, especially between 
the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, are fertile 
plains where agriculture flourishes; in Iraq, 
in particular, many of these plains benefit 
from being irrigated by a network of canals 
thousands of years old, though recent geo-
logical changes, combined with the little 
effort made by the government to address 
the effects of these or maintain the existing 
network, have sharply reduced their pro-
ductivity. To the north, east, and northwest 
of these plains, the terrain becomes more 
mountainous, making cultivation more

When they strike with their hooves 
against an opponent, sparks fly.
The aladlammu and apsasu are guard-
ian creatures created by the gods of old, 
male and female respectively. Creatures 
with the same characteristics, but with 
winged human bodies to match their 
heads are called shedu if male, or lamassu if 
female. Colossal effigies of these beasts 
can be found among many major ruins of 
the ancient Middle East. They are fierce 
opponents of harmful spirits, and a re-
gion lucky enough to have an effigy can 
evoke the faerie to assist them if plagued 
by disease or demons. A character with 
an appropriate Area Lore and Faerie Lore 
can construct an amulet that constitutes 
an aladlammu’s Sovereign Ward (Realms 
of Power: Faerie, page 52).
These creatures are not suitable as 
player characters.

difficult, although valleys provide areas 
where crops may be grown. Meanwhile, to 
the west lies the great Syrian desert that 
divides Mesopotamia from Syria and the 
Holy Land; this desert also merges to the 
south with the Nefud of Arabia.
Most of the inhabitants of these re-
gions are Muslims, although there are 
also significant populations of Christians 
and Jews. The majority of people live in 
the cities, towns, and villages that cover 
the area, but the desert areas are home to 
a mix of wandering nomads and settled 
communities at oases.
The  
Starving Gods
The great gods, the Anunna,
Stayed parched and famished.[…]
But, like sheep, could only fill their 
windpipes (with bleating).
Thirsty as they were, their lips
Discharged only the rime of  
famine.[…]
(Atrahasis) put down…
Provided food…
The gods smelt the fragrance,
Gathered like flies over the offering.
	
	
— Atrahasis, Tablet 3
The gods of ancient Mesopotamia, 
as ancient Faerie creatures, offer interest-
ing possibilities as antagonists in sagas 
and stories. Faeries ultimately depend on 
human involvement with them to gain 
vitality, especially through the retelling 
of stories in which they are characters. 
However, the gods of ancient Mesopota-
mia have been largely abandoned by their 
worshipers. Nevertheless, the religion 
persists in scattered cult centers through-
out Iraq and the Jazira, notably Harran, 
Mardin, Ashshur, and Mosul. Although 
not sanctioned by Islam, the priests (many 
of them yatus — see Mythic Persia) walk 
without fear through the streets in their 
distinctive tall conical hats and tunics. 
These pitifully few worshipers are woeful-
ly insufficient to sate the gods, who have 
been forced to remain in hidden regiones 
for centuries. Literally starved of human 
interaction, they are desperate for atten-
tion and may by now not be too discrimi-
nating about how this attention is gained. 
Some may have grand ambitions of hav-
ing their cults resurrected. Others may 
simply seek to make friends with player 
characters, though their means of doing 
so may at times demonstrate a lack of un-
derstanding of human emotions, perhaps 
becoming aggressive or worse if their ini-
tial overtures are rebuffed.
The following represents a selec-
tion of the deities worshiped in ancient 
Mesopotamia:
Demons of Mesopotamia
Mythic Mesopotamia throngs with 
demons, some of whom have been active 
since ancient times. The uttuku are a local 
form of Mazzikim (Realms of Power: The In-
fernal, page 73), and are Infernal jinn (see 
Chapter 4: The Jinn). The galla-demons 
are powerful disease spirits similar to the 
Decani (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 
52), and are specifically opposed by the 
Aladlammu (see later). The lilu are a form 
of ghul who haunt the wastes of Mythic 
Mesopotamia, and are especially dan-
gerous to children and pregnant women. 
Their female counterparts are the lilitu, 
who are succubi (Realms of Power: The Infer-
nal, page 55). Finally, the gidim are Infer-
nal ghosts, specifically Reveners (Realms 
of Power: The Infernal, page 75) who return 
to torment bereaved families.
Among those who still worship the 
old gods (such as in Harran or Mardin) 
there is a class of priest-magicians called 
the ashipu, or exorcists. The practices 
of most ashipu consist of knowledge of 
the weaknesses of demons (through the 
Infernal Lore Ability), and how to con-
struct protective amulets that counter-
act them. Some ashipu may have more 
active powers against demons, and may 
be members of the Suhhar Sulayman.

god of arts, crafts, magic, and wisdom; 
cult center at Eridu.
Ellil: God of the earth; head of the young-
er gods (Igigi), and keeper of an object 
of supreme power known as the Tablet 
of Destinies; cult center at Nippur.
Ishtar: Goddess of fertility, sexual love, 
and war; cult centers at Uruk, Nineveh, 
and Erbil.
Dumuzi: God of flocks and agriculture; 
lover of Ishtar, for whom he spends six 
months every year in the Underworld.

of omens and divination using animal 
livers; cult center at Aleppo.
Mami: Great mother goddess; cult cen-
ter at Kesh (unknown site in central 
Mesopotamia).

Tiamat’s Creatures
In the Babylonian Epic of Creation, the 
primordial Tiamat engendered the line of 
gods with her consort Apsu, but later grew 
distressed by the tumult of the younger 
gods, and produced 11 races of monsters 
to exterminate them. Eventually she was 
killed by Marduk the champion-god, and 
the world was made from her corpse. Those 
who have studied the Magic Realm might 
recognize this myth as a version of the Ti-
tanomachia (Realms of Power: Magic, page 
108), where a race of faerie gods wrests 
power from primordial Magic beings.
Following the demise of their mother, 
the eleven types of monsters were pressed 
into the service of the gods. Those gods 
may now be fading in power, but their ser-
vants can still be found performing their 
ancient duties. These monsters are: the 
mushmahhu (a seven-headed dragon), the 
ushumgallu (a lion-dragon), the bashmu (a 
horned snake 60 leagues in length), the 
mushhushshu (a snake-dragon; see later), 
the lahamu (a giant covered in long curly 
hair), the ugallu (a man-like creature with 
a lion’s head and tail, and bird’s feet), the 
uridimmu (a man with the hindquarters of 
a lion), the girtablulla (scorpion-man; see 
later), the umu dabrutu (a fierce storm), the 
kulullu (a merman, half man, half fish), and 
the kusarikka (a man with the hindquarters 
of a bull, and bull horns).

hair and a braided beard. From the 
waist down, the girtablullu has the 
shiny black carapace of a scorpion, 
including its long tail equipped with 
a stinger. It stands on two clawed 
legs like those of a bird, and carries a 
bow. Some scorpion-men have bird-
like wings.
The gods appropriated the girtablullu 
as guardians of monuments and sacred 
places, and they are particularly associ-
ated with the sun god Shamash. Conse-
quently, these scorpion-men are encoun-
tered by those who investigate the ruins 
left behind by cultures past. Girtablullu 
are usually found in small groups, which 
constitute a Trained Group. They are 
most powerful during the day, suffering 
from the Poor Eyesight, No Sense of 
Direction, and Clumsy Flaws when en-
countered at night.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Iraq
There have been human settlements in 
Iraq for thousands of years, and this con-
tinues to be the case in 1220, especially 
along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. 
The ancient Faerie gods who used to rule 
over this land are no longer seen abroad, 
though remains of their ziggurat temples 
still tower into the sky to mystify pass-
ersby. Now Iraq is the political center of 
the Muslim world, a status it has held, with 
varying degrees of actual authority, since 
the ‘Abbasid takeover in 750. Soon after 
this event, the ‘Abbasids built their capital 
at Baghdad, from which they have reigned 
almost continuously ever since. For much 
of the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries, the 
‘Abbasid caliphs were figureheads under 
the control of their deputies, but since the 
reign of the caliph al-Muqtafi (r. 1136–
1160) the caliphs have been able to resist 
control by others and rule Iraq indepen-
dently. As noted earlier, the current caliph, 
al-Nasir, is a strong ruler; at times his di-
rect authority has also been acknowledged 
in the Jazira and parts of Persia, and many 
rulers of the provinces respect his author-
ity, in name at least.
Qasr Shirin
Overlooked by the mountains of the 
Persian plateau, Qasr Shirin (“the palace of 
Shirin”) is a large walled village on the road 
to Jibal province. It takes its name from Shi-
rin, the wife of the Persian king Khusraw II 
Parviz, who used to dwell here. The ruins of 
her palace remain, and on nights when the 
moon is full, the palace comes alive with Fa-
erie versions of Shirin, Khusraw, the sculptor 
Farhad, and the rest of their court, eternally 
re-enacting the story of the courtship of Shi-
rin. Characters who visit the site at the full 
moon take on the roles of characters in this

Harran (see later) who are still able to do 
so. Unless summoned, the mushhushshu 
roam through the hills and desert fringes 
of old Assyria, traveling between Magic

attack any armed foreigners within the 
borders of Assyria, but can be forestalled 
from attacking by offering interesting 
information or important news. Before

tale, gaining rewards or wisdom from their 
participation therein. A character might be-
come Shirin, sought after by two men and 
unsure which of them to love; she might 
become Khusraw, the king, who expects to 
receive all that he desires and is bemused 
when he is unable to gain what he wants 
through the force of his position alone; or 
he might become Farhad, jockeying for Shi-
rin’s affections even though his rival is the 
all-powerful king of Persia. Perhaps a trio of 
characters might take on all three roles, in-
teracting with each other in ways that they 
would not do in their regular lives.
Samarra
The capital of the ‘Abbasid caliphs be-
tween 836 and 892, the city of Samarra used 
to be a sprawling complex of richly deco-
rated palaces and mosques on both sides 
of the Tigris, where for most of that time 
the caliphs were virtual prisoners of body-
guards who in the meantime fought each 
other for control of their masters. How-
ever, after the caliphs returned to Baghdad 
the city fell into disrepair, and most of its 
buildings are now ruins. The major excep-
tion is the Great Mosque of al-Mutawakkil 
(r. 847–861), an immense structure that is 
largely intact and is particularly well known 
for its spiral minaret, which towers about 
180 feet above the ground.
In 1220 the majority of the inhabit-
ants of Samarra are Twelver Shi’is (Realms 
of Power: The Divine, page 112), who have 
remained in the city as it is home to the 
tombs of the 10th and 11th imams, as well 
a mosque with an underground chamber 
where the 12th imam vanished, which is 
also one of two places where he may reap-
pear at the end of time (the other being 
Hilla, described later). Thus these Shi’is 
await his return here.
Baghdad
Baghdad is the political center of Islam, 
insofar as it is the seat of the caliph, even 
though the caliph’s political reach is actu-
ally fairly limited. Founded by the second 
‘Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–75), the 
city has been home to the caliphs for most 
of the 458 years that have passed since its 
first stones were laid in 762. The oldest part 
of Baghdad is the Round City, the original 
triple-walled city founded on the west bank 
of the Tigris by al-Mansur, at the center 
of which lies the Bab al-Dhahab (Golden 
Gate) palace, which was the first caliphal 
palace. Over the next two centuries, the 
caliphs expanded the city on both sides of 
the river, building mosques, palaces, and 
gardens, so that it enjoyed a summer of in-
tellectual and cultural achievement. 
However, Baghdad has declined great-
ly since the old days. Repeated fires, floods 
and civil conflict have left much of it in 
ruins. On the west bank, each of the quar-
ters is isolated from the others by walls and 
surrounded by a wasteland of architectural 
remains. On the east bank, the quarters 
around the caliph’s palace are prospering, 
but this only comprises a third of the city. 
Sectarian dissent between Shi’is and Sunnis, 
and also among different Sunni schools of 
law, are a cause of internal tension, which 
occasionally turns into violence. The major 
social group in the city unaffected by the 
decline is the Muslim mystic Sufis (SOO-
feez), who are flourishing as a result of 
the building of several ribats (ri-BAWTZ), 
The Courtship of Shirin
The Persian tale of Khusraw and 
Shirin is best known in the version by 
the poet al-Nizami (d. 1209). Khusraw 
II, the King of Persia, falls in love with 
Shirin, an Armenian Christian princess. 
However, their courtship encounters 
difficulties, at which point there ap-
pears a rival for Shirin’s affections, the 
supernaturally strong sculptor Farhad. 
Khusraw and Farhad contest with each 
other, and the rivalry grows intense. 
Eventually Khusraw is able to get rid of 
his rival by ordering him to cut away the 
Behistun cliffs in the Zagros Mountains 
to find water, a seemingly impossible 
task. Khusraw is briefly taken aback 
when news reaches him that Farhad 
has completed the task, so he sends a 
message to Farhad that Shirin has died. 
Farhad, distraught, throws himself from 
the cliffs to his death. Before doing so, 
he throws away his axe, made of pome-
granate wood, and where it falls there 
grows a pomegranate tree, the fruit of 
which will cure any illness. Meanwhile 
Khusraw’s courtship of Shirin continues, 
and after he has proven himself through 
many acts of heroism, including killing a 
lion with his bare hands to save her life, 
she finally consents to marry him.
Story Seeds for Samarra and Baghdad
A Samarran Covenant
While parts of the city of Samarra 
are holy sites, it is a sprawling complex 
of buildings covering a wide area, and 
it may be that parts of it hide Magic 
auras and devices left behind from the 
activities of sorcerers at the courts of the 
caliphs. Thus it could be an attractive 
place to set up a covenant, particularly 
as even though the buildings are ruined, 
the underlying structures (wells, irriga-
tion canals, etc.) remain largely intact. 
The major question is how the current 
mundane population of the city would 
react to a bunch of foreign wizards set-
ting up home nearby.
The Wandering Caliph
From a scant few years after his death 
right up to the current day, the Suhhar 
Sulayman have heard tales of encounters 
with Harun al-Rashid. These encounters 
start innocuously enough, as a chance 
conversation with three strangers, but 
usually blossom into strange and fantasti-
cal adventures in Golden Baghdad. Many 
sahirs believe this Harun al-Rashid (ac-
companied by his vizier and executioner) 
to be the faerie ruler of Golden Bagh-
dad, and those whom he invites across 
the Threshold into the Faerie Realm are 
chosen based on a contribution they can 
make to the betterment of his city.

or hospices, for them by the caliphs. The 
caliphs have also been building or restor-
ing a number of other religious institutions, 
including the city’s many mosques, shrines, 
and religious colleges, in an attempt to ease 
tensions, remove the divisions in the com-
munity, and promote a cultural revival.
Every summer, many of the streets and 
most of the open land on the south side 
of Baghdad fills with stalls and tents in an 
enormous fair. This event is well-attended 
by merchants and travelers from all over 
the Mythic Middle East, and typically lasts 
most of the season. It is said that all man-
ner of goods and services may be found 
at this event, including unique items and 
entertainments brought by strange men 
from fantastic lands. Visitors are cautioned 
to maintain a clear idea of what they seek 
before they go exploring, for there are 
said to be many vendors who appear only 
when their wares are especially desired, or 
who lure unwary travelers into their tents 
where they disappear forever. The summer 
bazaar is the site of the yearly meeting of 
the Suhhar Sulayman (Chapter 3: Order 
of Suleiman: The Majlis al-Suleiman).
The Dar al-Hikma
More Solomonic sahirs live in Baghdad 
than anywhere else in the world — easily a 
thousand of them. The city is home to no 
less than eight buyut al-hikma, including 
the great academy that sahirs call Dar al-
Hikma, which was originally established 
by the First Council in Baghdad, north of 
the palace and halfway between the Bab al-
Sham and the Bab al-Khurasan. This large 
building currently houses nearly a hundred 
young and old sahirs living and studying 
together, and is overseen by Niya al-Wa-
ziriyya al-Jabr Satefa al-Inshai al-Qasri al-
Qalb. It is known to have an exceptional 
astrological observatory, with perhaps the 
finest astrolabe ever constructed to date, 
and the architecture is as grand as that of 
the Bab al-Dhahab Palace and Mosque.
The Dar al-Hikma typically chooses 
its leader, and thus the representative 
for Majlis, based on the achievements of 
those who attend the academy. Niya has 
discovered a unique method of combin-
ing her Solomonic arts, yielding two spells 
that allow her to summon a spirit directly 
from the Magic Realm and to summon 
multiple spirits at once. For this reason, 
she was chosen by the other sahirs to lead 
the bayt, despite her relative youth and the 
fact that she has The Gift. She will prob-
ably become Asala of the Ashab al-Qalb 
once her predecessor dies. She is said to 
believe that the Suhhar has stagnated, 
and that Gifted sahirs (in both senses) are 
its best hope to avoid extinction. This is 
a controversial position, as less than ten 
percent of the Suhhar have The Gift and 
Gifted sahirs are not generally admired.
Golden Baghdad
As noted previously, Baghdad enjoyed 
its time of greatest prosperity during the 
reign of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, and 
this period has left its mark on the city. 
Scattered across Baghdad are numerous 
places where it is possible to cross into a 
Faerie version of the city. Here the roofs 
are covered with gold, the streets are 
paved with marble and the tales of the 
Arabian Nights are re-enacted, with or with-
out the participation of visitors. Here it is 
possible to receive a visit at night from the 
caliph Harun al-Rashid, his vizier Ja’far the 
Barmakid, and his executioner, Masrur the 
eunuch, who frequently venture out in dis-
guise to observe the behavior of the city’s 
inhabitants, rewarding the good and pun-
ishing the bad. Here one might find one-
self eavesdropping on Sinbad the Sailor as 
he recounts his adventures to Sinbad the 
Porter. One might even travel beyond the 
walls of the city, going fishing with Judar 
the fisherman, seeking the ring of Solo-

mon with Bulukiyya, or helping Hasan, 
the goldsmith of Basra, to obtain the love 
of a jinn maiden. It is also possible to take 
the role of one of these characters, experi-
encing their adventures firsthand.
The entrances to Golden Baghdad may 
take any form, from a simple mundane 
doorway that happens to lead there, to an 
invisible gate that can only be perceived 
by those with Second Sight, Faerie Sight, 
or similar magic or powers. It is entirely 
possible to stray through such entrances 
into the Faerie Realm (Realms of Power: Fa-
erie, page 20) without initially being aware 
that one has done so, especially in cases 
where the Guardian actually forms part 
of the Threshold. Indeed, straying into 
Golden Baghdad by accident is a common 
enough hazard that it is an acceptable 
excuse for absence among the people of 
the mundane version of the city, and most 
people in mundane Baghdad have visited 
Golden Baghdad at least once. Members 
of the Suhhar Sulayman have attempted to 
map the entrances to Golden Baghdad, but 
entrances behave differently for different 
people, and most appear, disappear, and 
change, seemingly at random, with the re-
sult that only a small number of relatively 
stable entrances have been identified with 
any certainty. Members of the Suhhar also 
debate whether supernatural creatures 
found in mundane Baghdad are native to 
the mundane world, or are visitors from 
Golden Baghdad who have strayed the 
other way through such portals.
Al-Mada’in
Al-Mada’in is a small but densely-pop-
ulated town to the southeast of Baghdad. 
In the seventh and eighth centuries it was 
a much larger complex of seven towns, but 
over the years it has gradually declined. It 
is still much admired for its mosque, near 
which is the tomb of Salman the Persian, 
an important companion of the Prophet. 
Al-Mada’in is also the site of the ancient 
ruins of Ctesiphon, the Persian imperial 
capital, and the ruins of the imperial pal-
ace still remain as witnesses to the passing 
of Sassanid power.
The Christian 
Monasteries
Downriver from al-Mada’in are three 
Nestorian Christian monasteries (adyar 
(ad-YAHR), sing. dayr) that are unknow-
ingly interconnected. They each have 
their own unique features and are de-
scribed as follows.
Dayr al-’Aqul
Located on the banks of the Tigris, the 
monastery of Dayr al-’Aqul is surrounded 
by a fairly large town of the same name, 
which includes a major mosque. Here the 
monks levy a toll from river traffic, which 
they share with the townsfolk, making it 
a major source of income for the town as 
a whole. However, recently the monks 
have noticed that rapid changes are taking 
place in the river’s banks, with the result 
that the river is gradually drawing away 
to the west, which means that they may 
soon be cut off from the source of their 
livelihood. All attempts to prevent these 
changes have failed, and both the monks 
and the townsfolk suspect that some su-
pernatural force may be involved. They 
have been unable thus far to identify their 
enemy, but some suspect that the monks 
of the monastery of Dayr Qunna may in 
fact be foul sorcerers seeking the destruc-
tion of Dayr al-’Aqul.
Dayr Qunna
A mile to the east lies the monastery of 
Dayr Qunna, which is a large building with 
walls that are so strong and high that the 
monastery resembles a fortress. This is per-
haps not entirely surprising, as the building 
is not actually a monastery but a bayt al-
Story Seeds for Al-Mada’in and Dayr al-Aqual
The Ruined Palace
The imperial palace at Ctesiphon is 
remarkable for the vaulted arch over the 
remains of what used to be the Persian 
emperor’s throne room, which is over 
110 feet tall at its highest point. This is 
of great interest to practitioners of the 
Mystery of Hermetic Architecture (The 
Mysteries, pages 97–101). If a charac-
ter seeks membership in such a cult, he 
might be asked to investigate the site 
as part of his Initiation. Otherwise, the 
characters might be asked to accompany 
a cult member to Ctesiphon on some 
pretext. Investigating the site presents its 
own challenges though, as the people are 
likely to be suspicious of foreign strangers 
poking around in the ruins of the palace.
The Enemies of Dayr al-’Aqul
Who is diverting the Tigris River? 
The characters get involved when they 
are caught in a sudden change of direc-
tion of the river, and are rescued by the 
monks of Dayr al-’Aqul. The sahirs of 
Dayr Qunna may be keen to restrict 
the spread of the Dominion near their 
fortress, so they have a motive. In ad-
dition, if any of the sahirs have sum-
moned spirits that are stronger than 
they can control, these may be trying 
to make trouble for their summoners. 
Alternatively, the culprit may be at 
Dayr Hizqil. Perhaps the monks there 
would like to claim the income from 
the toll levied on the Tigris traffic, in 
which case they may, with supernatu-
ral aid, be trying to cause trouble for 
either or both of the other monaster-
ies. Or perhaps one of the inmates is to 
blame. Unbeknownst to the monks of 
Dayr Hizqil, the sahirs of Dayr Qunna 
recently dropped off at the madhouse 
one of their own who had summoned 
forces greater than he could control, 
which blasted his mind and destroyed 
his sanity; perhaps he has now attained 
enough coherence to seek revenge. Or 
maybe an enemy sorcerer is hiding at 
Dayr Hizqil, merely feigning insanity 
to allow him to direct magical attacks 
on Dayr al-’Aqul and Dayr Qunna. Fi-
nally, perhaps a demon or faerie is the 
one making trouble, thriving off the re-
actions of the mortals involved.

Dayr Hizqil
20 miles south of Dayr al-’Aqul is the 
town of al-Nu’maniyya, within which is 
the monastery of Dayr Hizqil. Here the 
monks maintain a madhouse, caring for 
those who have been afflicted with in-
sanity. To work in such a place requires a 
strong mental and physical constitution, 
and the monks are mostly down-to-earth, 
brawny types who are well-capable of 
manhandling their charges if need be.
The Ruins of Babylon
“And you, Belshazzar his son, have 
not humbled your heart, even though you 
knew all this! You have exalted yourself 
against the Lord of heaven! The vessels 
of his temple have been brought in before 
you, and you and your lords, your wives 
and your concubines have been drinking 
wine from them. You have praised the 
gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, 
wood, and stone, which do not see or hear 
or know; but the God in whose power is 
your very breath, and to whom belong all 
your ways, you have not honored.” […] 
That very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean 
king, was killed.

The city of Babylon, in southern Iraq, 
has been the site of many dramatic events 
of history. It witnessed the chaining of 
Harut and Marut, the angels who taught 
magic to humans and now hang bound 
beneath the ruined city; the building of 
the Tower of Babel; the exile of the Jews; 
the construction of the Hanging Gardens 
by Nebuchadnezzar; and the subsequent 
destruction of the city and Belshazzar’s 
kingdom by the Persians. As such, it is 
a site of great potential interest to ex-
plorers. More details on Babylon and its 
mysteries may be found in Ancient Magic, 
pages 12–15.
The Epic of Gilgamesh
Of him who found out all things, I

Of him who experienced every-

He searched lands everywhere.
He who experienced the whole

He found out what was secret and 
uncovered what was hidden.
He brought back a tale of times

He had journeyed far and wide,

He had the wall of Uruk built, the

           — The Epic of Gilgamesh,  
	
	
Tablet 1
The ancient Mesopotamian Epic of 
Gilgamesh attained its final form in the 
eighth or seventh century BC, though it 
owes its origins to a variety of much old-
er stories about the mythological king of 
the city of Uruk, who may be based on a 
real person who ruled two millennia ear-
lier. It tells the tale of King Gilgamesh 
and his friend Enkidu, who adventure 
together until they are cruelly torn apart 
by the vengeance of the gods. There 
are actually three known major variants 
of the tale; the following is a very brief 
summary of the most popular version.
King Gilgamesh of Uruk is an un-
popular ruler, and the gods send him 
Enkidu, a wild man, to distract him. En-
kidu is tamed by Shamhat the temple 
prostitute, and after a wrestling match in 
which neither wins, Gilgamesh and En-
kidu become close friends. Seeking fame 
and honor, the pair go to the Pine Forest 
to slay the monster Humbaba. Upon re-
turn to Uruk, the goddess Ishtar tries to 
seduce Gilgamesh, but he rejects her. In 
a rage, she brings the destructive bull of 
heaven to attack Gilgamesh and Enkidu, 
but they slay it and insult Ishtar. The 
gods decide that the pair have gone too 
far and strike Enkidu with a fatal illness.
The distraught Gilgamesh takes to 
wandering in the wilderness. He makes 
it as far as the gate through the moun-
tains that guard the sunrise, where he is 
permitted to pass by the humanoid scor-
pions that guard it. Beyond, he meets 
Siduri the alewife, who advises him to 
go home and make the most of this life, 
since the afterlife is nothing to look 
forward to. Gilgamesh is undeterred, 
and he obtains directions from Siduri 
to the abode of Utnapishtim, a mortal 
king who was made immortal by the 
gods after he survived the great flood. 
Gilgamesh fails to obtain immortality 
from Utnapishtim, and is instead forced 
to return to Uruk with only the wisdom 
that he has gained on his journey. This 
is sufficient to make him a good king.
Characters who take on the role of 
Enkidu in this story, then, are doomed 
to die. This is something that may be 
known to some of the players, even 
though it is highly unlikely that any of 
the characters will know it. Any player 
who, despite knowing the fate that lies 
in store, still has her character adopt En-
kidu’s role and allows the character to be 
killed not only achieves an Unmitigated 
Success in re-enacting the story, but 
should also receive an extra Confidence 
Point as a reward for bravery at the end 
of the session.
Ancient Mesopotamians did not be-
lieve that death meant the complete end 
of existence, but rather that the human 
soul was transported to a dry, dusty un-
derworld where the dead led a miserable, 
dreary existence: essentially a place de-
void of vitality. To faeries, the deserted 
Temple of Uruk, abandoned by humans, 
is a symbol of such a place, and any 
character who has died as Enkidu thus 
finds himself sent through the Guardian 
portal back to the temple, alive and hav-
ing gained whatever he sought.
Storyguides may wish to draw out 
the suspense by having any compan-
ions of the dead character complete the 
remaining story of Gilgamesh’s travels 
before they also are returned to the 
temple, where they will find their ap-
parently deceased comrade alive.

The Great Swamp
South of Babylon lies the Great 
Swamp, a marshy area that stretches be-
tween the two rivers until they join further 
south. Despite a noxious atmosphere and 
frequent plagues of insects, the swamp is 
dotted with villages and towns inhabited 
by determined souls who have managed to 
drain small patches of land and grow crops 
on them. Navigation through the swamp 
is primarily achieved using shallow-drafted 
boats. The inhabitants of these swamps 
are pagan followers of the old religion, al-
though in the absence of a formal priest-
hood they have but fragments of their faith 
left to them. One tale they do know, and 
have faithfully recited for generations, is 
the Epic of Gilgamesh (see previous page).
The Ruins of Uruk
In the center of the Great Swamp rise 
the ruins of a mighty stepped ziggurat, 
all that remains of a great temple to the 
goddess Ishtar. Local people stay clear of 
the site, since some of those who visited 
it have never returned. The temple has 
a Faerie aura of 2. In addition, explor-
ers who break through a rubble-strewn 
doorway (actually a Faerie Guardian) 
find themselves inadvertently passing 
through an entrance to the Faerie Realm 
of Elysium. The Threshold Strength here 
is 33, but those who visit the temple and 
cross the doorway automatically accu-
mulate the requisite number of Thresh-
old Points (major border (12) + trod 
(the doorway, aura 5) + any temporal 
thresholds + any personal thresholds + 
any shortfall made up by the Guardian’s 
Spirit Away Faerie Power). See Realms of 
Power: Faerie, pages 18–21.
Upon entering the Faerie Realm, 
characters encounter Gilgamesh, who 
seeks to make one or all of them iden-
tify with Enkidu, taking on his role in this 
tale; this sets them on the Path of Des-
tiny (see Realms of Power: Faerie, page 33). If 
they agree, Gilgamesh sends the charac-
ters out into the wilds, there to await the 
arrival of Shamhat.
The Whirlpool at Ubulla
On the north side of a canal leading into 
the Shatt al-’Arab lies the town of Ubulla, 
a busy settlement with palaces, mosques 
and markets. However, in the late eighth 
century the town was plagued by a vicious 
jinni, who took the form of a whirlpool in 
the Shatt al-’Arab and wrecked any ships 
that came within its reach, thus blocking 
the trade route between Baghdad and the 
Persian Gulf . The jinni was only defeated 
through the cleverness of Zubayda bint 
Ja’far, the wife of Harun al-Rashid. She dis-
covered through her studies that the jinni 
in question was vulnerable to stone, so she 
had a large number of ships loaded with 
stones, floated to the whirlpool, and then 
sunk, filling the jinni’s maw and burying it 
in the riverbed, thus calming the waters 
and enabling ships to travel the Shatt al-
’Arab once more.
Basra
Located on two canals leading into the 
Shatt al-’Arab, Basra is an important city in 
southern Iraq. It contains numerous shrines 
and mosques, the best known of which 
is the mosque built by ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, 
which has a minaret that shakes or remains 
still depending on whether an oath sworn 
before it is true or false. This is a miraculous 
effect, and cannot be fooled or resisted. Bas-
ra is also well-known for its library, which 
reputedly contains over 15,000 books.
Kutha
Within the town of Kutha stands an 
immense tower of solidified ashes, all that 
remains of a furnace built by the ancient 
tyrant King Nimrod, the builder who also 
built the Tower of Babel. Nimrod attempt-
ed to kill Abraham by hurling him into this 
furnace, despite the fact that Abraham was 
the son of his vizier Terah, but God com-
manded the flames to be cool, and Abra-
ham walked out unharmed. Meanwhile, the 
furnace itself was consumed by the flames, 
and only the Tower of Ashes remains.

Karbala’
Karbala’ is a site associated with a 
traumatic event in Muslim history, hav-
ing witnessed the violent end to one of 
the first Shi’i revolts against the Umayyad 
dynasty. In 680 al-Husayn, the son of ‘Ali 
ibn Abi Talib and grandson of the Prophet, 
sought to advance his claim to the caliph-
ate after the death of the caliph Mu’awiya. 
However, he and his followers were inter-
cepted and slain at Karbala’ in the desert 
by Umayyad troops. This event sent an 
emotional shockwave through the Mus-
lim world; this was, after all, the Prophet’s 
grandson. The event is still remembered 
with regret by all Muslims and particularly 
mourned by Shi’is, who hold ceremonies 
commemorating the event on the day of 
‘Ashura’ ((‘ah-shoo-REH’), “the Tenth”), 
the 10th day of the Muslim month of Mu-
harram (mu-HAR-ram).
Karbala’ is now home to a small town, 
at the center of which is the tomb where 
al-Husayn’s body is interred (his head is 
in Cairo), which is a major place of pil-
grimage for Shi’is. It takes the form of a 
domed shrine surrounded by a garden 
pool. The gateway of the shrine itself is 
made of silver, while inside the tomb is 
lit by golden and silver lamps. The other 
doorways in the shrine are closed off by 
curtains of silk. Pilgrims coming to the 
tomb kiss the silver gateway before en-
tering to pray. The tomb has a Domin-
ion aura of 8, and visitors may attempt 
to invoke baraka from al-Husayn’s tomb 
in the form of any of the following Saint 
Powers: Apparition, Acknowledgement of Evil, 
Expel Demons, Resist Temptation, Grant of Se-
renity, Straighten the Crippled, The Faithful 
Made Whole, Celestial Immunity, Mass Heal-
ing, Humility of Caesar, Terrify the Unbeliever. 
Al-Husayn has a Divine Might of 75. See 
Realms of Power: The Divine, pages 87–89 
and 105, for further details.
Hilla
The city of Hilla occupies both sides 
of the Euphrates River, though its greater 
part is found on the western bank. The 
two sides are joined by a bridge of boats 
held fast by great iron chains. Hilla con-
tains a shrine where it is said that the 
twelfth imam will reappear at the end of 
time, so many Twelver Shi’is live here, 
awaiting his return. Indeed, Hilla is a 
center of Twelver Shi’i scholarship, with 
many religious scholars making their 
homes in the city.
Story Seeds for the Great Swamp
The Whirlpool at Ubulla
The jinni at Ubulla is imprisoned on 
the riverbed, but not slain. The char-
acters get word of a group of sorcerers 
who are planning to free the creature 
and use it as a weapon with which to 
impose their will on the caliph. Should 
they try to prevent this directly, or 
should they try to warn the caliph, all 
the time knowing that the sorcerers 
back in Ubulla are gradually getting 
closer to achieving their goal?
The Thief of Basra
The characters catch someone steal-
ing books on arcane lore from the li-
brary at Basra. The thief is taken to the 
minaret, and there his guilt is confirmed 
and he is sentenced to have his hand cut 
off. However, before the punishment is 
carried out, the thief tells the characters 
that he was only conducting the theft at 
the command of a sorcerer who is hold-
ing his family hostage. He begs them 
to gain proof of this so that his crime 
will be pardoned, as well as to rescue his 
family and keep them from harm. If the 
characters agree to help, the local chief 
qadi ((QAW-dee), “judge”) gives them a 
week to obtain the proof required.
Of course, it may be that the thief is 
in fact lying, and there is no sorcerer or 
family, in which case the characters re-
turn from their wild goose chase only to 
discover that the thief has escaped and 
they are now responsible for tracking him 
down again. This may be a tricky task if 
the thief also has supernatural powers.
Nimrod’s Furnace
[Abraham] said: Worship ye then in-
stead of Allah that which cannot profit 
you at all, nor harm you?
Fie on you and all that ye worship in-
stead of Allah! Have ye then no sense?
They cried: Burn him and stand by 
your gods, if ye will be doing.
We said: O fire, be coolness and 
peace for Abraham,
And they wished to set a snare for him, 
but We made them the greater losers.
And We rescued him and Lot (and 
brought them) to the land which We 
have blessed for (all) peoples.
	
          — The Qur’an 21: 66–71
The furnace was originally dedicat-
ed to the powers of Hell, and was home 
to a fiery demon. However, direct inter-
vention from God on Abraham’s behalf 
made it into a holy object and trapped 
the demon inside to quell the flames. 
Now, a cabal of corrupted individuals 
seek to light the fires of Nimrod’s Fur-
nace once more, a feat that can only be 
achieved by weakening of the faith of 
Kutha’s inhabitants, followed by profan-
ing the testament to Abraham’s miracle 
by burning holy men to death within it.
The Scholars of Hilla
The characters are contacted by a 
powerful but physically disabled Shi’i 
sahirs, who asks them to travel to Hilla 
on his behalf and seek the wisdom of 
a scholar named Muhammad ibn Mu-
hammad, who makes his home there, 
providing the characters with a list of 
questions that they must ask him. How-
ever, it quickly becomes clear that there 
are three scholars with this name in the 
town, all of whom have wildly varying 
responses to the questions, and also 
that relations between these scholars 
are intensely hostile due to their theo-
logical differences. The characters will 
have to spend a considerable amount of 
time, and no small amount of tact and 
diplomatic energy, to gather all three 
scholars’ answers without upsetting any 
of them (by clearly associating with ei-
ther of his rivals) and causing them to 
become uncooperative.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Najaf
The city of Najaf is of immense 
importance to Shi’is, as it contains the 
tomb of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib. As described 
earlier, ‘Ali was killed in 661, an event 
which took place in Kufa. As he died, 
he instructed that his body should be 
put on a camel, which should be turned 
loose, then followed; where the camel 
knelt was where he should be buried. 
This was done, and for a long time his 
supporters kept the location of his grave 
secret, fearing that the Umayyads might 
desecrate the site if they found it. How-
ever, in 791 the ‘Abbasid caliph Harun 
al-Rashid was hunting nearby, and he 
chased a deer into a thicket and then 
discovered that neither his horse nor his 
hounds could enter the spot. He made 
his servants dig in the thicket, and when 
they discovered the corpse of ‘Ali he or-
dered a tomb to be built on the spot. This 
tomb has been refurbished and expanded 
over the years, and it is now an ornate 
structure that forms the focal point of 
the city and sees visits from thousands of 
pilgrims every year. Najaf is also home 
to an immense graveyard, where several 
prophets and numerous important Shi’i 
nobles are buried. There are also several 
madrasas, mosques, and other religious 
institutions here.
The shrine of ‘Ali takes the form of 
a gold-domed structure, on each side of 
which is a monumental portal with a sil-
Ighraq al-Siq
Ighraq al-Siq (“the drowning flood of 
the gorge”) is an ancient pagan spirit of 
the Tigris, now confined to a gorge on 
the lower or Lesser Zab, a tributary of 
the Tigris (also called Majnun, “the mad 
river”) from its impetuous currents. Once 
able to range freely along the length of 
the river, he is currently confined to a spe-
cific stretch in the lower reaches known 
as the Siq al-Majnun, or sometimes just 
“the Jinni’s Gorge”. He is responsible for 
the paroxysmal Spring flooding through 
this narrow canyon. This immediate can-
yon area has a Magic Aura of 6.

ver doorstep. It is richly decorated with 
glazed tiles, thick carpets and gold and 
silver lamps. The doorways are covered 
with silk curtains, and silk hangings also 
adorn the walls inside the structure. The 
actual tomb itself is surrounded by a rail-
ing made of engraved gold plates held 
together with silver nails. The Domin-
ion aura in the shrine has a score of 8, 
and visitors may pray for baraka from 
‘Ali to invoke any of the following Saint 
Powers: Acknowledgment of Evil, Apparition, 
Celestial Immunity, Cure Blindness, Expel De-
mons, Grant of Serenity, Mass Healing, Resist 
Temptation, Straighten the Crippled, The Faith-
ful Made Whole, Humility of Caesar, Rebuke 
the Unfaithful, and Terrify the Unbeliever. 
The shrine is particularly well known for 
healing miracles, so attempts to invoke 
Saint Powers of this type enjoy a +1 bo-
nus. ‘Ali has a Divine Might of 75. See 
Realms of Power: The Divine, pages 87–89, 
for more.
Kufa
About seven miles northeast of Najaf 
lies the city of Kufa. This used to be a 
vibrant settlement, but recently it has de-
clined and much of the city is in ruins; al-
though in the eastern part of the town the 
Great Mosque of Kufa remains in good 
condition. This is the mosque where ‘Ali 
was mortally wounded by his killer, and 
the site of the attack is marked by a mi-
hrab that has been built on the spot. Kufa 
Ighraq al-Siq (cont’d)
and amor are also created with this 
power. He cannot become fatigued. 
This body lasts until he decides he 
no longer needs it. Killing the body 
does not kill Ighraq al-Siq.
Grant Water Lore, 5 points, Qik –13, Vim: 
Ighraq can grant the Minor Mystery 
Virtue Water Lore to an individual 
either temporarily or permanently. 
Characters granted this Virtue could 
improve it further through Adven-
ture, Exposure or Experience like 
any other Nature Lore (see Houses 
of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 103–
104). The Source Quality of Ighraq’s 
canyon is normally 4 but magi able 
to persuade the malevolent jinni 
to teach them can use the normal 
Teaching rules as an exception to the 
usual rule — in this case Ighraq’s ef-
fective Source Quality is 9.
Grant Wilding, 10 points, Qik –23, Vim: 
Ighraq can grant the Major Mys-
tery Virtue Wilding to an individual 
with an existing Water Lore score 
either temporarily or permanently 
(see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, 
pages 105–106).
Presence, 0 points, constant, Mentem: 
Once released, Ighraq al-Siq is aware 
of everything that goes on within his 
haunt. This power needs to Penetrate 
to perceive beings with a Magic Re-
sistance. (35 levels, 3 Mastery points 
spent on reduced Might)
Transform into Floodwave, 4 points Init –4 
(affected by the Slow Power Flaw, 
takes an additional round of prepara-
tion to activate), Aquam: Ighraq al-
Siq can transform into a floodwave, 
seemingly drawing on the water of 
the stream to appear as an elemental. 
(45 levels)
Vis: 2 pawns of Aquam vis can be col-
lected every year from his haunt, in 
the form of clear rainwater that col-
lects within a niche carved into the 
stone block that imprisons him. If 
slain in a physical form or dispersed 
in elemental, his body yields 8 pawns 
of Aquam vis within perfectly smooth 
stones of varied hue.
Appearance: Ighraq al-Siq appears as a 
thin giant with blue-green complex-
ion and straggly green-black hair 
like water weeds. He carries a large 
spear and is clad in a vest of water-
smoothed stones. Once manifested, 
this humanoid form can disperse 
into his preferred elemental form, a 
floodwave carrying a hail of stones 
that can travel upriver or downriver 
along a watercourse as a marauding 
torrent. The effect of a Deluge of Rush-
ing and Dashing when invoked within 
the narrow confines of the gorge is 
particularly devastating. 
Story Seed: Jinni Blocks
Since ancient times the spirit Ighraq 
al-Siq has been trapped inside a Jinni 
Block — a type of unusual tower tomb 
placed at the entrances to the ruins of 
some lost cities. The process may be 
similar to the Goetic Art of Binding, 
but an unknown effect triggered by 
intrusion into the Majnun canyon area 
releases Ighraq al-Siq from his impris-
onment and compels him to drive off 
intruders. While trapped within the 
block, Ighraq al-Siq is essentially unable 
to affect his surroundings in any way 
and cannot be detected by magic, as he 
becomes part of the native stone. The 
stone block is granted the jinni’s Magic 
Resistance, but can still be eroded and 
broken by the elements and other non-
magical attacks. 
Over time, the area immediately sur-
rounding the block has become a fixed 
Arcane Connection to the spirit, provid-
ing a +1 bonus to the Penetration multi-
plier and replacing his original physical 
locus. A character who actually stands 
barefoot on top or touches the prison 
block is considered to have a stronger 
Arcane Connection to Ighraq al-Siq, 
gaining a +3 Penetration multiplier bo-
nus, and also gains the benefit of the en-
trapped spirit’s Magic Resistance. A sahir, 
summoner, or Hermetic magus can use 
his magic to attempt to command Ighraq 
al-Siq using scouring (Realms of Power: 
the Infernal, page 117) or Sihr by stand-
ing within the vicinity of the Jinni Block 
even if he is unaware of his presence. A 
failed attempt at controlling him, how-
ever, will trigger his release and invoke 
his displeasure.

The Cradle & The Crescent
continues to be visited by Shi’i pilgrims, 
usually on the way to or from Najaf.
The Jazira
To the north of Iraq lies the Jazira. Like 
Iraq, this is mostly a fertile area where ag-
riculture flourishes. Much of the region is 
ruled by the Ayyubids, who currently spend 
much of their time intriguing against each 
other, with the result that those cities that 
are not ruled directly by them are able to 
assert their independence, only acknowl-
edging their authority in name. Most of 
the rulers here, including the Ayyubids, 
acknowledge the ultimate authority of the 
caliph, although again this has little real 
impact on them.
Mosul
Mosul lies on the east bank of the Ti-
gris, opposite the remains of the ancient 
city of Nineveh. Since 1128 the city has 
been held by members of the Zangid 
(ZANG-gid) family, whose progeni-
tor, ‘Imad al-Din Zangi (d. 1146) is best 
known for having taken Edessa from the 
crusaders in 1144. Currently Mosul is ef-
fectively ruled by a Mamluk regent, Badr 
al-Din Lu’Lu’, ruling on the behalf of the 
emir al-Qahir Mahmud and acknowledg-
ing Ayyubid overlordship.
Mosul is defended by a double wall, a 
strong citadel and, on the east side, the Ti-
gris itself. Outside the walls are suburbs and 
fertile gardens, while a wide north-south 
road runs through the city itself. Many of 
the houses are built of marble. Mosul con-
tains numerous important religious sites, 
including mosques housing the tombs of 
Jonah and St. George (who is also a proph-
et in Islam), a healing spring, a squash tree 
planted by the Prophet himself, and several 
madrasas and Christian monasteries. The 
population here consists of a mixture of 
Muslims, Christians and Yazidis (on the last, 
see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 136).
Mosul is particularly well known for its 
textiles. Indeed, it is from the name of the 
city that the word “muslin” is derived.
Barqa’id
The city of Barqa’id is avoided by 
travelers, for it is populated almost en-
tirely by thieves who rob unwitting 
visitors and prey on caravans passing it 
Story Seeds for Kufa and the Jazira
The House of Ibn Muljam
As indicated in Chapter 2, ‘Ali was 
killed by a political opponent with a poi-
soned sword. His killer, named ‘Abd al-
Rahman ibn Muljam, was subsequently 
executed. However, his sword was taken 
away by associates and buried in a house 
where he secretly stayed while he was in 
Kufa, in which it has subsequently spread 
an Infernal taint while also becoming an 
object binding ‘Abd al-Rahman’s ghost 
to the site. Since then the house has 
changed hands many times; because of 
the uncomfortable feeling there, and the 
many household accidents that occur, it 
has been labeled as cursed, although the 
locals do not know why. The house fi-
nally passes into the hands of a friend of 
the characters who has enough insight to 
realize that there are supernatural forces 
at work, and he contacts them to ask for 
their help in discovering and removing 
the cause of the troubles. However, by 
the time the characters reach Kufa the 
spirit has become strong enough to pos-
sess their friend. Can they remove the 
taint and defeat the ghost without harm-
ing him?
Tensions in Mosul
The people of Mosul follow a righ-
teous path, doing pious works. You will 
meet none of them but has a cheerful 
countenance and a soft word. They are 
generous to strangers, receiving them 
kindly, and using justness in all their 
dealings with them.
	
— Muhammad ibn Jubayr  
           	      (d. 1217), Travels
The characters are contacted by a 
magus or sahir who recently traveled to 
Mosul. The wizard in question, having 
read the travelogue of Ibn Jubayr, de-
cided to investigate and see if the leg-
endary kindness of the people of the 
city had a supernatural cause. However, 
his magical experiments in the city have 
gone awry, and he has inadvertently set 
the people against each other, so that 
civil war is brewing. The wizard has 
the Blatant Gift, impeding his ability 
to defuse the tension, so he asks the 
characters to come and act as mediators 
between the hostile factions while also 
helping him to cancel the effects of his 
magical meddling.
Against the City of Thieves
The characters are victims of a raid 
conducted by the people of Barqa’id, and 
their victory over the thieves is witnessed 
by the inhabitants of a local village, who 
offer them succor. When they arrive at 
the village they find themselves welcomed 
like heroes, and it quickly becomes evi-
dent that the people are expecting them 
to destroy Barqa’id and rid them of their 
oppressors. How will the characters re-
spond to these expectations?
The Battle for Nasibin
Nasibin is actually the site of an in-
visible battle for souls between an angel 
and a demon, of which the outward man-
ifestations are the roses and the scorpi-
ons. So far, the battle between the two 
has reached only a stalemate, but either 
party might decide to try and enlist the 
aid of the characters. If the characters are 
taken in by the appeals of the demon, ei-
ther succumbing to promises of rewards 
or mistaking the disguised demon for an 
angel, they may unwittingly find them-
selves aiding the cause of Hell.

The Cradle & The Crescent
on the road to Nasibin. As a result of 
its ever-worsening reputation, and the 
consequent reduction in the number of 
travelers passing near it, its inhabitants 
have become ever bolder in their atroci-
ties, attacking other nearby towns and 
villages, to the point that their victims 
have appealed to the rulers of Mosul and 
Nasibin for help; however, each ruler has 
refused, claiming that it is the other’s 
responsibility and leaving the people to 
fend for themselves.
Nasibin
An important center of Nestorian 
Christian scholarship and the seat of a 
bishop, the city of Nasibin is home to a 
mixed population of Christians and Mus-
lims. It is famous for its gardens, said to 
be 40,000 in number and blessed with un-
usually large and fragrant white roses, but 
also for its scorpions, which deliver a par-
ticularly venomous sting and fill the city in 
great numbers.
The Astrologers of Nasibin
For most of the history of the Suhhar 
Sulayman, Nasibin was home to a great 
bayt al-hikma known as the House of 
the Heavens, the seat of the great fam-
ily of Solomonic astrologers called the 
Ashab al-Najm. This was a series of five 
large buildings carved from white stone 
and placed around a central building that 
housed an observatory with an astrolabe, 
with a great procession of statues in the 
courtyard between them fashioned to 
represent each of the ancient Babylonian 
figures associated with the planets and zo-
diacal constellations.
In the year 1186, however, a fascinat-
ing event occurred. It is said that soon 
after the vizier representing Nasibin and 
the Asala al-Najm returned to the bayt 
from that year’s Majlis, they and all of 
the other sahirs of the city departed in 
a mass exodus. Some of them had made 
arrangements and had their possessions 
ready to transport, while others simply 
set down their work and left whatever 
they were doing unfinished. This depar-
ture occurred just before the end of sum-
mer, and astrologers have calculated that 
at about that time all seven planets were 
in the sign of Libra, a rare event that in-
dicates powerful celestial influence in acts 
of subtlety, independence, and the assis-
tance of others.
Neither the Asala nor the vizier who 
once led the House of the Heavens have 
been heard from since, and so have never 
explained this strange direction the great 
house suddenly took, but there are now 
many groups of sahirs who tell different 
stories and give different reasons. The 
predominant belief is that they scattered 
to better assist Salah al-Din in the Battle 
of Hattin and the recapture of Jerusalem 
in 1187, though others say they acted to 
put a plan into place that would remove 
Rashid al-Din Sinan of the Syrian Nizaris 
(see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia, The Nizari 
Isma’ili State).
All of the remaining sahirs from Na-
sibin now travel in roving caravans across 
the Mythic Middle East, each occasion-
ally stopping in one place or another 
when the stars seem right. Their mobile 
laboratories are still more common in 
Jazira than other regions, being closest to 
where they came from. Meriq, the cur-
rent Asala (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia, 
Savah) maintains that their family bayt is 
still located in Nasibin, even though no 
one currently lives there, and supposes 
that those who left must eventually re-
turn there one day.
Mount Judi
Mount Judi is believed by the Mus-
lims to be the final resting place of the 
Ark of Noah. The mountain is topped by 
a mosque marking the spot, and at its foot 
lies the city of Thamanin (“eighty”), said 
to have been founded by eighty of Noah’s 
companions, whose inhabitants claim de-
scent from this illustrious group.
Amid
The black basalt city of Amid has 
been massively fortified by its Turk-
ish overlords with thick walls, multiple 
watchtowers and iron gates. The central 
portion of the town includes a high hill 
upon which is built the citadel. Outside 
of this wall lie the suburbs of the city, 
again enclosed by fortified wall. The city 
is home to several religious buildings, in-
cluding both a major Sunni mosque and a 
great Jacobite church, both of which are 
built of black basalt and iron and are re-
nowned for their beauty.
The over-fortification of Amid is the 
result of repeated attacks on the city made 
over the centuries by immense armies of 
Faerie creatures, wielding wood and stone 
weapons and clad in an ancient and un-
known form of leather armor. The precise 
reason for these attacks is unclear, though 
Mount Judi and Mount Ararat
And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy 
water and, O sky! Be cleared of clouds! 
And the water was made to subside. And 
the commandment was fulfilled. And (the 
ship) came to rest upon al-Judi and it was 
said: A far removal for wrongdoing folk!
	
          — The Qur’an 11: 44
And in the seventh month, on the 
seventeenth day of the month, the ark 
came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
	
         — The Bible, Genesis 8: 4
According to the Bible, Noah’s 
ark came to rest upon Mount Ararat 
in Armenia, something that accords 
with Christian and Jewish belief, but 
contradicts Islamic belief. In fact, 
both groups are right in a sense: the 
remains of the ark are in a regio that 
may be reached from either mountain. 
On Mount Judi it is possible to enter 
the resting place of the ark from the 
mosque; characters have merely to 
walk through the mihrab, even though 
it appears to be made of solid marble, 
in order to be transported there. For 
more on Mount Ararat and the resting 
place of Noah’s ark see Ancient Magic, 
pages 70–73.

they always take place on the spring equi-
nox. The people of the city have become 
fatalistically used to preparing for these 
attacks on a regular basis. On the other 
hand, the shared foe has proved to be a 
factor that has led to extremely good rela-
tions between the Muslims and Christians 
of the city.
Raqqa and the 
Battlefield of Siffin
Once a residence of the caliph Harun 
al-Rashid, Raqqa is enjoying something 
of a resurgence under the Ayyubids. Its 
markets are flourishing, and it is famous 
for its blue-glazed ceramics. Meanwhile, 
on the opposite side of the Euphrates 
from the city is the site of the Battle of 
Siffin, which was fought between ‘Ali ibn 
Abi Talib and Mu’awiya ibn Abi Sufyan in 
657. After several months of skirmishing, 
Mu’awiya asked his opponent for resolu-
tion of their dispute by arbitrators. ‘Ali 
agreed, but some of his followers did not 
and so abandoned him; Ibn Muljam, who 
slew ‘Ali, was an adherent of this dissent-
ing group.
The supporters of ‘Ali who died in the 
battle are buried here, and it is possible 
to see through the ground to their uncor-
rupted bodies from afar. However, when 
one comes to the places where they lie, 
the bodies may no longer be seen. The 
battlefield is a place of holy pilgrimage 
for Shi’is.
Harran
Currently ruled by the Ayyubids, the 
city of Harran has an ancient pedigree as 
the dwelling place of Abraham, and later as 
the first center of the scholarly movement 
that began translating many works of Clas-
sical scholarship into Arabic in the eighth 
century. About nine miles south of the city 
is a shrine marking where Abraham and Sar-
ah dwelled. Harran is also famous as having 
been the center of a cult of monotheistic 
star-magicians known as the Sabians, who 
were first encountered by the Muslims in 
the ninth century; they are said to have since 
died out, but some may still exist, posing as 
Muslims to avoid harassment. Harran is also 
home to a prominent cult dedicated to the 
Ashshur, patron god of the Assyrians.
Edessa
The city of Edessa has changed hands 
many times in its history, having been held 
variously by the Byzantines, the Muslims, 
and others. In 1098 it was taken by the cru-
saders, who made it the capital of one of 
their four states. However, as noted previ-
ously, on Christmas Eve 1144 it was con-
quered by Zangi, and it is currently under 
the control of the Ayyubid sultan of Aleppo, 
al-’Aziz (r. 1216–1236). The majority of the 
population are Christians of various church-
es, and its chief claim to fame used to be a 
Christian relic, the Holy Mandylion — a 
cloth bearing an image of Christ’s face that 
was sent by him to King Abgar of Edessa. 
However, this relic was given to the Byz-
antine Emperor in exchange for prisoners 
by the Muslim rulers of Edessa in the tenth 
century, and then lost when the crusad-
ers sacked Constantinople in 1204. What 
became of the relic remains unknown, but 
the people of Edessa hope it will be miracu-
lously restored to them someday.
The Sanjah Bridge
Crossing the River Sanjah, a tribu-
tary of the Euphrates, is an exceptionally 
well-made bridge, consisting over a single

The Cradle & The Crescent
arch over 200 paces long, made from huge 
blocks of dressed stone. This was con-
structed in ancient times by a sorcerer 
working for a local ruler, who was aided 
by a talisman that he carried. The talisman 
is now implanted in an arch at the crown 
of the bridge. No one knows exactly what 
its function is, nor what would happen if it 
were to be removed.
More Story Seeds for the Jazira
The Death of Tenik
In ancient times there were two 
chieftains named Tigran and Vasdes. Ti-
gran ruled a village on the site of Amid, 
while Vasdes ruled another village near-
by. One night, Tigran raided the village 
of Vasdes and took the latter’s wife, Te-
nik, hostage. The following night, the 
night of the spring equinox, Vasdes led 
his troops out to rescue his wife and 
take revenge on Tigran, but Tenik, who 
wished to prevent further bloodshed, 
threw herself between the two warbands 
in an attempt to halt the fighting, meet-
ing an accidental death under her hus-
band’s already-swinging club. Horrified, 
both men called a halt to the conflict and 
resolved their differences.
The Faeries at Amid seek to re-enact 
the conflict of Tigran and Vasdes, but 
they are unable to bring it to its final 
resolution due to human ignorance of 
the story. In the meantime, their army, 
the Faerie manifestation of the warband 
of Vasdes, has grown as Amid has grown, 
with the result that it continues to be a 
threat to the city. The characters learn 
of the story from a Faerie that lives near-
by and realize that the conflict may be 
brought to an end if someone takes the 
role of Tenik and falls under Vasdes’ axe. 
Yet how may this be achieved without 
someone having to die?
The Dead of Siffin
The identity of one of the corpses 
buried at Siffin causes concern for the 
characters.
Perhaps the one of the bodies, from 
a distance, looks like an ancestor of a 
character, in which case, why is the 
ancestor here among the dead? Did an 
ancestor of the character travel here 
and become involved in the fighting 
between ‘Ali and Mu’awiya? If the an-
cestor was in the region for a significant 
amount of time the character may have 
other, unknown relatives in the region, 
waiting to be found. This has even more 
interesting implications if the character 
in question is Gifted; perhaps there is 
a whole magical lineage to which she 
is related.
Alternatively, maybe the cause for 
concern is a corpse that, from a distance, 
resembles a still-living character or one 
of the characters’ associates. Is this a 
warning of some sort, a premonition of 
the future?
Of course, with both storylines the 
characters will need to find ways to ob-
serve the corpse in question more close-
ly, to ensure that they are not merely see-
ing a coincidental resemblance. This can 
probably be achieved using magic either 
to gain a closer view of the body or to 
mark the grave so that they may disinter 
the corpse. Of course, if they do the lat-
ter, they will have to ensure that they are 
unobserved by people who might object 
to them disturbing the site.
The Heat Is On
This is a town with no beauty about 
it. It has no shade to mitigate its fever-
ish heat, and its climate follows from 
its name (harran, “hot”). Its water bears 
no acquaintance with freshness, and 
its squares and outskirts never cease to 
burn from the heat of its midday sun. 
No noontime place of rest will you find 
there, and you will breathe no air that is 
not heavy. Thrown into the naked waste, 
it has been founded in the midst of the 
wilderness and, without the brightness 
of a city, its shoulders have been stripped 
of the clothing of verdure.
	
— Muhammad ibn Jubayr  
           	      (d. 1217), Travels
Why is Harran so unusually hot? The 
characters discover that the growing heat 
in the town is the work of remnants of 
the Sabian magi, who hope that by mak-
ing the city inhospitable they may drive 
away the population, leaving it an empty 
site that they may excavate for ancient 
treasures of their tradition and in which 
they may resurrect their cult. This desire 
to reclaim the site may find sympathetic 
ears among the characters, since Her-
metic magi often have mixed feelings 
about similar mundane encroachment on 
magical sites. The magi may be tempted 
to aid the Sabians in their efforts, or 
they may seek to arrange some sort of 
compromise that allows them to practice 
their magic while leaving the local popu-
lace undisturbed.
The Holy Mandylion
The Image of Edessa (as the Holy 
Mandylion is called by the West) is now 
in possession of Otto de la Roche, the 
crusader Duke of Athens, not only one 
of the most powerful mundanes in the 
Theban Tribunal, but now virtually in-
vincible thanks to this powerful relic. For 
his persecution of the orthodox clergy, 
the pope has recently excommunicated 
de la Roche (see The Sundered Eagle, Chap-
ter 5: Athens, and 9: Relics of Constan-
tinople). The characters are somehow 
motivated to return the relic to Edessa; 
perhaps they are hired by an Armenian 
nobleman (or magus), or else it is neces-
sary to defeat a great evil that threatens 
Edessa.
The Missing Talisman
The characters are approached by 
representatives of the villages around 
the Sanjah Bridge. The talisman has 
been stolen, and the bridge is starting 
to crumble at a supernaturally fast rate. 
The local villagers depend on the bridge 
to allow them to transport crops to mar-
ket. Can the characters track down the 
thief? Even if they do, can they restore 
the talisman’s magical effect before the 
bridge collapses completely?

The Cradle & The Crescent
Arzanjan
The bustling market town of Arzanjan 
is mostly populated by Armenian Chris-
tians. It is famous for the quality of the 
various pieces of work produced by its 
crafters, with pride of place going to its 
brass-smiths, who produce works of re-
markable beauty in shapes unattainable by 
the brass-smiths of other towns.
Azarbayjan
Azarbayjan is a mountainous province 
to the north of the Jazira. Both it and the 
province of Arran to the north are nomi-
nally ruled by a dynasty known as the Ata-
begs (A-ta-begz) of Azarbayjan, the current 
head of which is Muzaffar al-Din Uzbek (r. 
1210–1225), who rules from Tabriz. Uz-
bek’s rule lies lightly on his domain; much 
of it is left in the hands of local governors, 
and Uzbek himself both acknowledges the 
overlordship of the Khwarizm-Shah and 
pays tribute to the king of Georgia.
The population of Azarbayjan is in-
credibly diverse. Ethnically, it includes 
Turkic peoples, Persians, and people from 
the Caucasus, while its religious tapestry 
includes a broad mix of Muslims, Chris-
tians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and followers of 
other religions. As a result of its terrain, 
communities are very scattered and its ma-
jor centers are little more than large towns. 
The lingua franca of the region is a Turkic 
language, though most of the people also 
speak local dialects.
Lake Urmiya
Taking its name from the town on its 
western shore, Lake Urmiya is a startling 
shade of blue and smooth as glass. At its 
center is a small island inhabited by fish-
ermen, who catch the strange dog-headed 
fish that inhabit the lake. In ancient times 
this island was home to a powerful sorcer-
er who conducted experiments on these 
fish, but an explosion triggered by a failed 
experiment destroyed most of the tower, 
including its master, though catacombs 
remain beneath the ruins. The residue of 
the sorcerer’s magical activities and the 
natural beauty of the setting have left the 
lake with a Magic aura of 2, rising to 3 on 
the island.
Maragha
The city of Maragha seems to enjoy 
the favor of some supernatural entity, for 
it is surrounded by flourishing orchards 
that produce a strange type of melon, 
green-skinned with red flesh, that tastes 
like honey. In addition, the sky is always 
clear here, so the city is favored by as-
tronomers who enjoy the opportunity to 
study the heavens without having to rely 
on good weather. 
Gilan
The province of Gilan is a relative 
backwater in the Muslim world, not be-
ing particularly rich or famous. Most of it 
is mountainous and covered with jungle, 
but the coastal plain is fertile, and the 
people who live here grow various crops 
including rice and wheat. The local rul-
ers of Gilan pay tribute to the rulers of 
Jibal, to the south, but are otherwise 
broadly left alone to rule the province in-
dependently. The emir of Gilan has been 
forced into a political alliance with the 
leader of the Nizari Isma’ili (see Chapter 
8: Mythic Persia).
Playing an Arzanjani Brass-Smith
Arzanjani brass-smithshave a magi-
cal talent that allows them to manipulate 
brass by hand, enabling them to produce 
exceptional pieces of work. This is rep-
resented by the Minor Supernatural Vir-
tue Lesser Power (Realms of Power: Magic, 
page 45), which is gained through guild 
Initiation. The Initiation Script to gain 
this power always includes the Minor 
Personality Flaw Vow (guild loyalty). 
Mechanics for Initiation can be found in 
The Mysteries Revised Edition, pages 8–16. 
Organization Lore: Arzanjani Brass-
Smiths’ Guild may be used in place of 
(Mystery Cult) Lore in this instance.
Crafter of Brass
1 Fatigue level, Init equal to (Qik 
– 6), Terram
R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind
A piece of brass touched by the user 
of this power becomes supple to the 
touch, so that it can be reshaped into a 
different form. This does not enable the 
smith to fuse pieces together, so she must 
still carefully cut out the basic shapes of 
the objects to be made. However, it does 
enable an imaginative smith to create 
pieces of great intricacy and beauty.
ReTe 15 (base 4, +1 Touch, +1 
Conc, +1 for intricacy): Lesser Power 
(15 levels, –2 Might cost)
A character may begin the game 
with this Virtue, in which case she 
should also take the Vow Flaw and a 
score of 1 in Organization Lore: Arzan-
jani Brasscrafters’ Guild. She should also 
consider taking Flaws that represent the 
experiences of her Initiation.
Story Seed:  
To Learn the Craft
A magus of House Verditius is 
intrigued to learn about the powers 
of Arzanjani brass-smiths and sends 
the characters to find out more. He 
particularly encourages one of the 
characters (perhaps a filius) to learn 
the Mystery, so that they may later 
examine its similarities to aspects of 
Verditius Magic. However, in order to 
achieve this the characters will have 
to persuade the elders of the Arzanjani 
BrassSmiths’ Guild to initiate one of 
them, including convincing them that 
their secret will not be shared with the 
world at large.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Barvan
Barvan is the major city of Gilan and is 
notable only for its bad reputation, being 
said to have no good houses or markets. 
It also does not possess a major congrega-
tional mosque, although a number of minor 
mosques do exist. The Dominion aura in the 
city is unusually low, with a score of only 1.
Mukan
Most of the province of Mukan con-
sists of a swampy plain stretching from the 
mountains in the northwest portion of the 
province to the Caspian Sea. Much of this 
area is cultivated, with rice and wheat be-
ing particular crops grown here.
Bajarvan
One of the chief cities of Mukan is Ba-
jarvan, which while a modest settlement 
enjoys its fame through proximity to the 
source of the Water of Life, which is said 
to be near the town. However, no one has 
yet managed to find the fountain, or if they 
have, they have not returned to tell the tale.
Arran
As noted earlier, the province of Arran is 
ruled by the Atabegs of Azarbayjan, though 
their actual involvement here is minimal. 
The majority of the population follows Ar-
menian Christianity, but there is also a sig-
nificant Sunni Muslim community here, in-
cluding most members of the ruling classes.
Baylaqan
The most important city in Arran is 
Baylaqan, which stands in a river valley 
supplied by several streams, with the result 
that the town has many mills, as well as 
Story Seeds for Azarbayjan and Gilan
The Sorcerer’s Tower
The secluded tower at Lake Urmi-
ya could be a good site for a new cov-
enant. Alternatively, it also provides 
a great excuse for an old-fashioned 
dungeon crawl, should the players feel 
nostalgic for the early days of roleplay-
ing. In both cases, given that the sor-
cerer clearly bred the hybrid dog-fish 
found in the lake, it is more than likely 
that the tower and the tunnels below 
it house all sorts of hybrid monstrosi-
ties that may oppose or welcome the 
characters, depending on the needs of 
your saga.
Dim Skies and Rotten Fruit
An unheard-of thing happens: the 
skies above Maragha become cloudy. 
At the same time, the melon crop fails 
suddenly, going rancid overnight. The 
player characters are asked to investi-
gate, and they soon discover that the 
town has fallen out of favor with the 
supernatural entity that up until now 
ensured its prosperity. The question is, 
what act by the populace has earned 
the creature’s enmity, and how may it 
be appeased?
To Build a Mosque
Some of the people of Barvan 
would like to see a major mosque built 
in the city, both to provide a gather-
ing point for the people and to improve 
the town’s reputation, but the governor 
is not of particularly pious inclination 
and would rather spend his money on 
worldly pleasures. In addition, the most 
logical way to build such a mosque 
would be through the expansion of one 
of the existing mosques, but the towns-
folk cannot agree on which mosque to 
expand. The characters are prevailed 
upon to act as external mediators both 
with the governor and between the 
leaders in the various mosques. Can 
they come up with a solution that will 
please everyone?
Khidr and the Water of Life
Khidr (the Green One) is an impor-
tant Muslim prophet. He is said to be 
immortal, having drunk or dived into 
the Water of Life, which he found by 
means of a shining jewel brought from 
Paradise by the prophet Adam. Ac-
cording to some stories, he and Alexan-
der the Great sought the Water of Life 
together, crossing a dark land to find 
it. Alexander, however, became lost, so 
that only Khidr actually reached the 
goal of their quest.
Khidr wanders the world giving 
advice wherever God directs him; 
indeed, he is believed to have given 
guidance to all the prophets who have 
lived since his birth, with the excep-
tion of Muhammad, who instead tu-
tored Khidr. Khidr has power over the 
sky, the sea and all plant life, and is a 
particularly important figure to the Su-
fis, who see him as the epitome of the 
Sufi shaykh. Khidr usually appears as 
a venerable Muslim in a woolen cloak. 
As a result of diving into the Water of 
Life, his skin and clothes are a bluish-
green color.
Khidr is best used as a mysterious 
adviser to the player characters. He is 
unlikely to reveal his true identity to 
them, and at times he will give advice 
that seems bizarre and unreasonable, al-
though it will always be proved correct 
in the end (see Moses and Khidr, later). 
Should the characters wish to find the 
Water of Life — which purportedly 
grants immortality to those who bathe 
in it — they need to seek his guidance, 
though he will only help them in this if 
their intentions are pure.

flourishing gardens and orchards. However, 
this idyllic setting has recently become the 
site of discord, as the citizens are divided 
about how to treat a popular preacher who 
raves about a “storm gathering in the east” 
that will soon engulf its people. Some wish 
to lock him up or even have him executed, 
while others hail him as a seer.
Shirvan
To the north of Arran and Mukan lies 
the province of Shirvan, a mountainous 
region with a number of towns dotting 
the valleys. For centuries the province has 
been ruled by a Persianized Arab dynasty 
known as the Shirvanshahs (shir-VEHN-
SHAHZ), who rule from their capital at 
Shamakhi. Currently power is shared be-
tween two members of the royal family: 
Farrukhzad I ibn Manuchihr III (r. after 
1187–before 1225) and his son Garshasp 
I (r. 1204–1225). The majority of the in-
habitants of Shirvan are either Sunni Mus-
lims, like their rulers, or Christians.
Shamakhi
The royal capital of Shamakhi consists 
of a town built entirely of stone, situated at 
the foot of a mountain and surrounded by 
gardens. Like Bajarvan, Shamakhi claims 
to be near to the source of the Water of 
Life, so it may be that explorers should 
start their search at the junction of the 
Cyrus and Araxes rivers. Shamakhi also 
possesses the Rock of Moses, which marks 
the spot where Moses met Khidr. A fish 
placed upon this rock by Moses and his 
servant came to life and swam away, and 
local people still come to the spot to pray 
for the healing of those languishing near 
death. For Muslims the rock is a relic with 
a Faith score of 3 and the Saint Power The 
Faithful Made Whole; see Realms of Power: The 
Divine, pages 43–46 and 88.
Georgia
The Christian kingdom of Georgia 
is, strictly speaking, outside the Muslim 
world, but its independence from Muslim 
rule is recent and hard won. Invaded by the 
Muslims in the 7th century, then embroiled 
in centuries of warfare with Muslim over-
lords, Georgia finally won independence in 
1121 when King Dawid II (r. 1073–1125) 
took the capital of Tiflis, which remains the 
The Fate of Baylaqan
The seer of Baylaqan is indeed cor-
rect, for in 1220 the Mongols descend 
on Baylaqan and destroy it. According to 
sources, since they are unable to find suit-
able rocks nearby for their mangonels, 
the Mongols cut down plane trees, saw 
their trunks into chunks, and use these 
as ammunition when they attack the city 
walls. They then pillage the city and burn 
it to the ground. Depending on when 
your saga is set, characters may arrive 
here either just in time to help fight the 
Mongols or after the conquest, in which 
case they may be asked to help rebuild.
Moses and Khidr
Then found they one of Our slaves, 
unto whom We had given mercy from 
Us, and had taught him knowledge from 
Our presence.
Moses said unto him: May I follow 
thee, to the end that thou mayst teach 
me right conduct of that which thou hast 
been taught?
He said: Lo! thou canst not bear 
with me.
How canst thou bear with that 
whereof thou canst not compass any 
knowledge?
Moses said: Allah willing, thou shalt 
find me patient and I shall not in aught 
gainsay thee.
He said: Well, if thou go with me, 
ask me not concerning aught till I myself 
make mention of it unto thee.
	
           — The Qur’an 18: 65-70
According to the Qur’an, when Mo-
ses and his servant met al-Khidr, Moses 
asked if he could follow the prophet and 
learn from him. Khidr initially suggested 
that Moses would not be able to accept 
his actions without protesting, and even-
tually only allowed Moses to follow him 
when he agreed not to do so.
Khidr then led Moses to a boat, 
which he scuttled. Moses protested, but 
Khidr reminded him of their agreement 
and Moses agreed to keep silent. The 
same thing happened when Khidr slew 
a young boy, and again when he built a 
wall near a city where some people had 
refused to give them food. After Moses’ 
third protest, Khidr explained his ac-
tions: The boat belonged to people who 
depended on it for their livelihood, but 
there was a coming a king who was tak-
ing possession of the boats of his people, 
so by rendering the boat unusable Khidr 
saved it from being taken. The boy, un-
like his parents, was not a believer in 
Islam, so Khidr slew him so that they 
might get a better child (according to 
tradition, they gave birth to a daughter 
who was the progenitor of many proph-
ets). The wall hid treasure that belonged 
to two orphans in the city, so by building 
it up Khidr was protecting it until they 
should be old enough to claim it. Moses 
and Khidr then parted ways.
The story of Moses and Khidr is a 
lesson in unquestioning obedience that 
might prove a useful model for Mystery 
Cult Initiations your saga. Magi might be 
required to follow a Mystagogue, keep-
ing silent in the face of apparently bi-
zarre acts. Sufis take the story as a model 
for the relationship of a Sufi student with 
his master.

The Cradle & The Crescent
capital of the state today. The current king 
is Giorgi IV Lasha (r. 1213-1223). 
Georgia is a country of mountains, 
hills and plateaux, with lowland areas only 
on the coast of the Black Sea and the val-
leys of the rivers Rioni and Kura. It is in-
habited by a number of different peoples, 
including Turks, Persians, Georgians, Ar-
menians and Alans. There are both Chris-
tians and Muslims among its population, 
although the dominant faith is its own na-
tional Christian church, which owes loy-
alty neither to the Pope in Rome nor the 
Byzantine Emperor.
Tiflis
Located on major trade routes, including 
the Silk Road, and itself a major trade center, 
Tiflis is a city of great importance in the re-
gion. As a result it has been hotly contested 
over the centuries, and this is reflected in its 
fortifications, which include double walls 
and three heavily reinforced gates. Despite 
this history of hostility between groups, 
Tiflis’ population is remarkably ethnically 
and religiously diverse and tolerant, and 
mosques, churches and synagogues exist at 
times literally next to each other in the city.
Greater 
Armenia
To the east of Asia Minor, and to the 
southwest of Georgia, lies the war-torn 
state of Greater Armenia. It is a land of 
mountains, high plains and valley basins. 
Its climate is very severe, with winters 
often lasting for over eight months. The 
country was conquered by the Muslims in 
the seventh century but managed to be-
come an independent, tributary state in the 
mid-ninth century. However, soon it was 
torn by wars between the Muslims and the 
Byzantines, and in the tenth Century many 
Armenians migrated to Lesser (Cilician) 
Armenia in Asia Minor. Greater Armenia 
fell to the Turks in the 11th century and 
remains a contested area, for the Ayyubids 
have annexed some of its southern terri-
tories; the Byzantine Comneni retain part 
of it under the control of their empire at 
Trebizond, to the northwest; and the rest 
lies in the hands of local dynasties.
The population of Greater Armenia 
is mixed, consisting mainly of Greek and 
Armenian Christians and Turkish Mus-
lims. They grow cereal crops, fish in the 
rivers, and mine various metals and min-
erals, including silver and salt. The area 
is also known for its weaving, dyeing, 
and embroidery.
Story Seed: Sorcery, Treason, and Plot
The characters prevent a magical 
murder attempt made on the King of 
Georgia, and they are charged to bring 
the perpetrator to justice. It is clear that 
magic was involved in the attempt (per-
haps a character saved the king from a 
bolt of magical lightning), which makes 
the need to find the person behind it 
all the more urgent. If a Hermetic ma-
gus was responsible, then he is guilty 
of breaking the Code’s prohibition on 
mundane interference, although a tri-
bunal must determine whether he has 
brought ruin on his sodales and thus li-
able for censure. On the other hand, if it 
was not a Hermetic magus, then it was 
clearly someone with power that might 
be a threat to the Order of Hermes, in 
which case the investigation is all the 
more necessary.
A Greater Armenian Covenant
Greater Armenia offers an attractive 
location for an Hermetic covenant, with 
its numerous isolated sites that have re-
sisted mundane encroachment and may 
preserve high-level Magical auras. In ad-
dition, the chaotic politics of the region 
makes it easy to establish an independent 
presence, provided that the characters 
do not become so powerful as to pose a 
threat to neighboring political leaders.
On the other hand, setting up a 
covenant in the area is not without its 
challenges. The severe climate makes 
a covenant difficult to supply and sup-
port. In addition, as the current tribunals 
reach their limits in terms of how many 
Hermetic magi they can support, other 
magi may also be looking to set up cov-
enants in the region and may challenge 
characters for the best sites.

Persia stretches from the Tigris River 
in the west to the Oxus River in the north 
and east. It is ethnically and culturally 
diverse; a consequence of both its vast 
size and its central position. However, 
over seven-tenths of its land area is desert 
and waste. Much of the country is high 
plateau, four to five thousand feet above 
sea level. Exceptions include the lands 
around the Persian Gulf south of the Za-
gros mountains, which are just above sea 
level, and the narrow coastal strip to the 
south of the Caspian Sea, which is just be-
low sea level. The plateau is bounded by 
the Alborz mountains to the north and the 
Zagros mountains to the south and west. 
The plateau lacks major rivers since they 
find no outlet; many rivers on the plateau 
are simply lost in sands and swamps, rather 
than reaching the sea.
Persians are linguistically and ethni-
cally different from the Arabs to the west. 
The majority of the population is found 
outside the great cities. Most are tenants, 
sharing their crops with their landlords, 
who tend to live in the towns. The low 
rainfall for most of the region results in a 
reliance on irrigation, through the use of 
underground water channels called qanats, 
which require constant and skilled mainte-
nance. A significant minority of the popu-
lation is nomadic or semi-nomadic; prin-
cipally the Lurs of the Zagros mountains 
and the Ghuzz of Khurasan. Most of the 
provinces are ruled by a dynasty of Seljuk 
Turks who have sworn loyalty to the cur-
rent shah; these rulers are either atabegs 
or mamluks. The atabegs were originally 
provincial governors who were tutors of 
Seljuk princes, but by the 13th century 
are semi-autonomous princes in their own 
right. The mamluks are raised as slave-sol-
diers to be utterly loyal to their masters, 
and placed in territories as direct subordi-
nates of the sultan.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The language of Persia is Parsi, or 
Persian, a tongue unrelated to other 
Middle Eastern languages. Arabic is the 
language of Islam, and retains its pre-em-
inence when discussing religion; it used 
also to be the language of all scholarship, 
but in the 13th century most Persian 
secular books are written in Parsi. Turk-
ish became well-established during the 
period of Seljuk dominance, and various 
dialects are found among the Ghuzz and 
the Lurs.
Recent History
The Seljuk Turks ruled Persia for 
nearly two centuries. It was always an 
empire made of two halves, with a sultan 
appointed in Khurasan to rule the east, 
while the Seljuk overlord ruled from the 
west. The sultanate of Khurasan came to 
an abrupt end in 1149 when the Shansa-
bani family destroyed Seljuk rule there 
using infernal powers. To add to the 
troubles in Persia, the Ghuzz — who had 
been invited to settle in Persia and join 
the armies — rebelled in Khurasan in 
1151, and invaded the neighboring prov-
inces. Despite holding Sultan Ahmed 
Sanjar captive for over three years, the 
Ghuzz rebellion was short-lived, but the 
Seljuks never reclaimed Khurasan from 
the Shansabanis. 
Ala ad-Din Tekish, the Mamluk ruler 
of Khwarazm, expanded his territory fol-
lowing the gradual collapse of the Seljuk 
empire after the death of Sultan Ahmed 
Sanjar, and eventually defeated his suc-
cessor Togril III in 1194. Tekish’s son Ala 
ad-Din Mohammed continued his father’s 
work to conquer the remaining parts of 
the Seljuk empire, and proclaimed him-
self its shah in 1205, although the Ca-
liph has yet to recognize this title. Since 
then he has crushed the Shansabanis 
in Khurasan, and extended his reign to 
Transoxiana, and is now the ruler of a 
vast empire that stretches from the River 
Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. Two years 
ago the shah met with emissaries from 
Genghis Khan in Samarkand. The shah 
had them killed and shaved — a grave 
insult — and sent back to the Khan. It 
remains to be seen what the Great Khan’s 
response will be.
Persian 
Supernatural 
Factions
In addition to the Suhhar Sulayman 
— who are ubiquitous in Persia’s cities — 
there are five key supernatural factions who 
are active throughout Mythic Persia.
The Yatus
In ancient times, the kings of Persia 
received assistance from sorcerers who 
went by the name of yatus. Unlike the 
mobeds who served Persia in a sacred 
fashion, the yatus were wholly secular, 
and had practices that were deplored by 
the Mazdean priests. Several of the an-
cient Persian kings used cadres of these 
sorcerers attached to their armies; the ini-
tial successes of Darius and Xerxes against 
The Shahnameh
The “Epic of Kings” is the national 
saga of the Persian people, composed 
by Ferdowsi in the tenth century. It is 
a record of the pre-Muslim history and 
legends of Persia. It begins with the cre-
ation of the world and of man, and then 
the introduction of fire, metal-working, 
agriculture, and other technologies. 
The early kings and their accomplish-
ments are followed by the deeds of the 
great heroes: Saum, his son Zal, and 
grandson Rostam. The age of heroes 
ends with the conquest of Alexander 
the Great; Ferdowsi then gives the his-
tory of the Sasanids, and ends with the 
conquest by the Arabs (whom he calls 
“the Army of Darkness”).
The Shahnameh is written in Parsi, 
and copies are often beautifully illus-
trated and decorated with gold leaf, and 
run to seven volumes in length. A good 
quality copy such as this is a summa on 
Persian Lore, Level 4, Quality 12. It can 
also be studied as a series of tractatus on 
Magic Lore, Faerie Lore, Divine Lore, 
and Infernal Lore, each Quality 10.
Peri Faeries
The peris are the courtly faeries 
of Persia. Peris are almost exclusively 
female, and are extraordinarily beauti-
ful — a pretty maiden in Persia is oc-
casionally referred to as “peri-faced.” 
Their game statistics are the same as 
for lesser nymphs (Realms of Power: Fa-
erie, page 73), and they fulfill the same 
role as entrapping lovers. However, 
peris rarely have powers over plant life. 
Peris are occasionally accompanied by 
diminutive male assistants who cater to 
their every whim; these are effectively 
sprites (Realms of Power: Faerie, page 85) 
except that they have brightly-colored 
birds’ wings.
Pairika Demons
A pairika is the Persian term for the 
Aerial Powers (Realms of Power: The Infernal, 
page 42). These demons are treated as 
corrupt jinn by sahirs (see Chapter 4: The 
Jinn). They are cncountered throughout 
Persia and most commonly embody the 
crushing heat of the desert or the dread-
ful power of the earthquake.

the Greek city states can be attributed 
to the lack of preparedness among the 
Greeks for such magical assaults.
In the main, yatus of old were faerie 
wizards; legends hold them as the inven-
tors of the Ars Fabulosa (Realms of Power: 
Faerie, page 131), which encompasses 
Faerie Summoning and related practices. 
Oral history recounts that these Arts 
were adapted directly from Canaanite 
Necromancy, which is held to be the 
origin of all summoning powers. Some 
yatus followed darker Arts and it was 
these Goetic yatus who prompted the 
persecutions by the mobeds that eventu-
ally lead to the decline of Persian magi-
cal warfare. When the Suhhar Sulayman 
was formed, Persia contributed several 
lineages of yatus who had survived the 
Mazdean purges and the Muslim inva-
sions, and they brought with them the 
knowledge of True Names and the In-
vocation of Names of Power Virtue (see 
Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman).
The yatus today can be found in west-
ern Persia, Iraq, and the Northwest prov-
inces. Most are members of the Suhhar 
Sulayman, combining Faerie Summon-
ing with the Solomonic Arts, principally 
Solomonic Storytelling. Non-Solomonic 
yatus are faerie wizards specializing in 
the Ars Fabulosa. Faerie blood is quite 
common among the yatus. They are of-
ten pagan, which causes them to clash 
with many sahirs, so they tend to found 
closed communities of solely yatu buyut 
al-hikma.
The Mobeds
The glory days of Zoroastrianism are 
long gone, but the faith is by no means 
extinct. Enclaves of mobeds can be found 
in Yazd, Daylam, and Kirman. For more 
information on the mobeds, see Chapter 
5: Mythic Zoroastrianism.
The Nizari Isma’ilis
The original assassins, Nizari Isma’ilis 
are a fanatical sect who use murder to fur-
ther their religious and political agenda. 
They are a renegade faction of sahirs, and 
are detailed in Nizari Isma’ili State, later.

When a nasu enters an orifice on a

later as ten individuals. Each of these 
individuals is identical in every way 
to the original nasu, including having 
this power, except that each swarm, 
no matter how large, has a single 
pawn of vis. Every three rounds, a 
nasu swarm can gain three points of 
size, and its ability to grow is limited 
only by the number of corpses it has 
available; of course, as it grows, it at-
tacks living things and creates more 
bodies. CrAn(Vi) 25 (base 5, +1 
Touch, +2 Group, +1 requisite) Rit-
ual Power (25 levels, –2 Might cost,

Swarm Form 0 points, Init 0, Animal: A 
nasu does not attack as an individual, 
but rather as a swarm. The combat 
statistics are for an entire swarm, 
which must be the same Size or larg-
er than its opponent. Thus a swarm 
of 100,000 nasus (Size +3) can attack 
a standard group of humans. A nasu 
swarm cannot be killed by normal 
weapons, only by area effects such as 
fire or smoke. The storyguide should 
consider how much of the swarm is 
affected by the area effect and assign 
damage in terms of Might points: 
if one-fifth of the swarm is affected 
then it loses one Might point; if two-
fifths is affected it loses two Might 
points, and so forth. Greater Power 
— no Hermetic equivalent.
Vis: 1 pawn of Animal, in body.
Appearance: A three-inch-long fly, with 
a red and yellow striped abdomen. 
They make a fearful buzzing sound 
when they fly.
The nasu is a Persian magical non-
jinni spirit which is attracted to the bod-
ies of the recently dead, especially the 
corpses of magical creatures or sorcerers. 
They rarely take material form unless 
summoned; they are minor spirits, and 
any apprentice summoner can call one, 
which is why many masters are very care-
ful to indicate why they should never be 
summoned — one nasu can become mil-
lions in a matter of minutes if sufficient 
fresh meat is around. Although a magi-
cal spirit, nasu are not jinn and cannot 
be called by sahirs using Solomonic Sihr, 
although they can be summoned by wiz-
ards using (Spirit) Summoning.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Zahhak
Zahhak was a demonic ruler of Persia 
in its heroic age, holding the nation in his 
evil thrall. He ruled from Ctesiphon in the 
days of Jamshid (see Istakhr, later), and 
conquered Persia after sawing Jamshid in 
two. Under his reign, virtue was despised 
and wickedness lauded. His thousand-year 
reign was eventually ended by the hero 
Feridun. Since that time, a Zahhak has 
periodically appeared and been battled by 
Persian sahirs, but he has never achieved 
the same level of power that he did in 
Jamshid’s day.
Zahhak is not a demon in the tradi-
Story Seed: The Zahhak
The last Zahhak was the Shansabani 
Sultan Mohammed al-Ghuri, defeated 
14 years ago (see Ghur, later). It would 
be unusual for another to be formed so 
quickly, but some Persian sahirs believe 
that Genghis Khan is, or is advised by, 
a Zahhak. The predatory way in which 
he is turned towards Persia is typical be-
havior of possession by Azi Dahak. If, in 
your saga, Zahhak is behind the Mongol 
invasion, then a whole campaign could 
revolve around ridding the Horde of the 
demonic influence.
The first Zahhak was not killed by 
Feridun; rather, he was chained and bur-
ied under Mount Damavand (see Ma-
zandaran, later) with the assistance of 
an angel. He is no longer possessed by 
the demon, but dwells there still, pro-
tected from death by the divine bind-
ings about him. This ancient individual 
from Persia’s heroic age might be able 
to give an insight to characters facing a 
reborn Zahhak.

Powers:
Coagulation, 4 points, Init –1, Animal: Azi 
Dahak can form a physical body, and 
dismiss it at will.
Obsession, 1–3 points, Init –5, Vim: Azi Da-
hak can invoke the Personality Trait of 
Power Hungry. See Realms of Power: The 
Infernal, page 31, for more details.
Envisioning, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem: The 
demon can appear in the dreams of 
a person.
Possession, variable points, Init +2, Men-
tem: Azi Dahak usually places all of 
his Might Pool into possession and 
can control the actions of his victim. 
He cannot regenerate Might points 
until the possession ends, so he has to 
leave periodically. During this time, 
his victim suffers terrible dreams of 
his death and torment in hell, and 
may act to prevent the demon re-
turning. See Realms of Power: The Infer-
nal, page 32, for more details.
Trust of the Innocent, 1 point, Init –1, Men-
tem: The target of this effect loses all 
judgment and believes a specific lie 
(as long as it is passable) until present-
ed with evidence to the contrary. An 
Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor 
of 6 is allowed to resist the effect.
Forked Tongue of the Serpent, 3 points, Init 
–1, Mentem: The target believes any 
lie, no matter how preposterous, un-
til he relates that lie to someone else. 
At this point he realizes how ridicu-
lous the falsehood sounds, and the 
demonic power is broken. An Intel-
ligence roll against an Ease Factor of 
9 also reveals the lie to be false, with 
the first roll allowed an hour after the 
effect was used, and further rolls per-
mitted once every subsequent hour.
The Serpent’s Oracle, 2 points, Init –3, Vim: 
The demon can duplicate the effects 
of any Intellego spell for the cost of 
2 Might points. It may also gain a 
morsel of future knowledge, under-
standing the most immediate conse-
quences of any one specific action.
Empower the Possessed, 0 points, Init 0, Vim: 
Whenever a possessed victim is will-
fully using the Goetic Arts, Azi Dahak 
grants a bonus equal to his own score 
in that Art. Furthermore, the demon’s 
Hierarchy score can be used in place 
of the possessed character’s score.
Weakness: Abhorrent Material (flame 
from a Mazdean temple)
Vis: 8 pawns of Mentem vis prava, 
in eyes.
Appearance: On the rare occasions it 
takes material form, Azi Dahak is an 
immense winged serpent with three 
heads, bearing six eyes and three 
pairs of fangs on each head. When 
wounded, snakes and scorpions spew 
from its wounds.

The Cradle & The Crescent
tional sense. Rather, when Azi Dahak the 
demon possesses an individual, that per-
son becomes Zahhak. Possession is indi-
cated by the growth of a black snake from 
each of the victim’s shoulders. When cut 
off they simply regrow; only removal of 
the possession can cure them. The snakes 
crave human brains, and the victim is 
driven to satisfy this need by the demon 
inside him.
In the first instance, the possessing 
demon forces the new Zahhak to do evil 
deeds, but over time the victim is cor-
rupted by the whispers and promises of 
power of the demon, and so far none 
have resisted his lure. Once the victim 
embraces evil, he is taught the Goetic 
Arts (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 
114), and can use Ablating to extend his 
life, gain magic resistance, and call upon 
all manner of evil powers by stealing 
them from other demons and supernatu-
ral creatures.
The Ghuzz
The Ghuzz are a race of magic-
blooded humans who originate from the 
steppes to the north of Persia and east of 
the Caspian Sea. Legend tells that they 
are the scions of the biblical giants Gog 
and Magog, and there is no denying the 
giant blood that runs strong in these fear-
some tribesmen. In addition to their size 
and their warrior reputations, the Ghuzz 
are also infamous for their uncontrollable 
nature. They would be all the more ter-
rible if they could remain organized or 
loyal enough for long enough to make 
an effective force. The Ghuzz can be 
found in many of the southern provinces 
of Persia, particularly Kirman, Makran, 
and Seistan. Ghuzz breed and ride huge 
horses; those of the magic kin are the size 
of elephants.
Ghuzz Characters
All Ghuzz tribesmen have the Large 
Virtue, except for those in whom the 
blood of Gog and Magog runs strong. 
These, typically the leaders of the Ghuzz, 
are magic kin, and they have the Giant 
Blood Virtue, and a Greater Immunity 
to mental manipulation. These Ghuzz 
cannot be swayed through mundane or 
magical means, and thus cannot be con-
trolled through Leadership, Charm, or 
Folk Ken, through Virtues such as Inspi-
rational, or even through the Command 
the Masses Greater Power Virtue common 
among the Ghuzz leaders. The Ghuzz 
— magical kin or otherwise — often 
have the Rebellious Personality Flaw.
New Virtue: Greater Power 
(Command The Masses)
Major, Supernatural
This new Virtue grants the Com-
mand the Masses power that is de-
scribed later. The Greater Power Virtue 
is further described in Realms of Power:

– 2, Mentem: The Ghuzz can issue an

The character reacts adversely to 
any attempt to impose authority over

who are in command. He does not nec-
essarily have any desire to be a leader 
himself, but he does not easily submit 
to another’s leadership.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Fars
This province was the birthplace of 
two of the greatest Persian dynasties, the 
Achaemenians (6th–4th centuries BC) and 
Sassanian (3rd–7th centuries AD). It thus 
gave its name to the whole region, for the 
original name Parsa became Hellenized to 
Persis. Fars is currently an atabegate ruled 
from Shiraz by the Salghurid dynasty.
Climatically, the province is divided 
into two parts: the Hot Lands (Garmsir), 
the lowlands near the coast; and the Cold 
Lands (Sardsir) to the north, in the high-
lands. In its southwest corner is the desert 
of Mandistan.
Arranjan
The westernmost of Fars’ five great 
cities, Arranjan lies on the south bank of 
the Tab River, which forms the border 
with Khuzistan. It is surrounded by date 
gardens and olive groves, and is known 
for both soap and bitumen. There have 
long been Isma’ili strongholds on the 
many hilltops around Arranjan, and the 
city itself has recently been captured by 
the Isma’ilis.
Darabgerd
The circular city of Darabgerd was 
founded by a family of Daylamite origin, 
and has always held Isma’ili sympathies 
even if this has not been openly declared. 
Near Darabgerd is the Kubbat-al-Mumiya, 
the “Bitumen Dome,” which is locked by 
an iron door and opened once a year when 
an officer of the sultan arrives and gathers 
in a box the twelve months’ accumulation 
of bitumen for royal use.
Kajaran
This is a small but prosperous town 
near the Persian Gulf. Endemic to the re-
gion is a type of magical worm that grants 
skill and luck to those that possess it. The 
Story Seed: The Well of Hindijan
Hindijan is the port of Arranjan 
on the lower reaches of the Tab Riv-
er. Many fruitless nights have been 
spent by treasure hunters in Hindi-
jan, searching for a cache of treasure 
rumored to be hidden there. A certain 
well has drawn much interest from the 
treasure hunters; it emits poisonous va-
pors, such that any bird flying over it 
fall dead into the well. However, be-
cause of its poison, the well remains as 
yet unexplored.
Salt of Seven Colors
Near to Darabgerd is a hill where rock 
salt of seven colors is occasionally dug 
out. This salt is of interest to sahirs for it is 
Dedicated Vis (Realms of Power: Magic, page 
122), exceptionally suited to the summon-
ing of jinn, who find it particularly pleas-
ing. Each pawn of this vis gives the same 
bonus as two pawns of normal vis when 
summoning jinn (but not other types of 
spirit). Princes like to keep control of the 
salt mines and use the salt of seven colors 
to court sahirs, or reward them.
Story Seed: Summoner’s Salts
A sahir is gifted with a princely 
sum of salt of seven colors, either as 
an inducement or a reward for a trivial 
task. This allows him to summon and 
bargain with much more powerful jinn 
than he ever could before, and his 
benefactor hints that he can get much 
more. Unfortunately, the salt provided 
to the sahir is tainted to be highly ad-
dictive, and the jinni summoned keeps 
demanding more and more. This is fine 
while the benefactor keeps supplying 
the salt, but he eventually starts to 
ask for bigger and bigger favors. The 
sahir comes to the characters (or per-
haps is one of the characters) in need 
of solutions: how to escape from the 
powerful jinni he has summoned, and 
how to uncover the nefarious plot of 
his “benefactor.”
The Kajarani Worms
The worms are an unusual Beast of 
Virtue, in that they can be Enriched 
(Realms of Power: Magic, page 124) while 
they are still alive. A worm must be 
kept on its own in a box for a season, 
and not be exposed to any light during 
this period. Every day the worm must 
be fed twelve mulberry leaves, each one 
precisely folded into a pellet. At the 
end of the season, the worm grants the 
Luck Virtue to the person who fed it. If 
it was fed by more than one person, it 
dies. A Kajarani worm eats any other 
worms it comes across. After a year, the 
Enrichment process must be repeated, 
or else the worm dies. If repeated, the 
worm grows bigger — to the size of 
a mouse — and grants Puissant (Abil-
ity) Virtue to its owner in addition to 
Luck. To prevent the worm from dy-
ing it can be Enriched in the third and 
fourth years; the worm grows to the 
size of a cat and a dog respectively, and 
grants the Venus’ Blessing Virtue in the 
third year and the Wealthy Virtue in 
the fourth. 
All Virtues are cumulative, but if the 
worm dies, they are lost. However, in 
the third year the possessor of a worm 
cannot refuse to pander to the worm’s 
comfort (the Compulsion Flaw); and in 
the fourth year it begins to repulse him, 
eventually developing into the Fear 
Flaw. No one in Kajaran permits their 
worms to live for a fifth year, in fear of 
becoming another Haftvad.

The Cradle & The Crescent
fortune it grants is proportional to its size, 
but the Kajarani are careful not to allow 
the worm to grow too big. In the past, 
Haftvad allowed his worm to grow for 
seven years, into a glossy black dragon 
with a splendid saffron-colored pattern on 
it. Once a simple peasant, Haftvad used 
his good luck to became a tyrant who con-
trolled all the land from Basra to Kirman. 
His armies defeated King Ardeshir (found-
er of the Sasanid dynasty), and it was not 
until Ardeshir killed the elephant-sized 
dragon with boiling lead that Haftvad’s 
luck ran out and he was slain. Haftvad’s 
mighty fortress still exists, hidden high in 
the mountains.

The governance of the north district 
of Fars is administered from Istakhr, which 
was known to the Greeks as Persepolis. 
Around and inside the city are several 
buildings that date to the time of Jamshid 
and King Solomon. The shores of nearby 
Lake Bakhtigan are crowded with villages 
growing rice and pomegranates.
On the hills to the northwest of the city 
are the Sih Gundaban, the “Three Domes,” 
three great fortresses, behind which has 
been built a great dam in a deep gorge. The 
dam provides sufficient water for a thou-
sand men during a year long siege. There is 
also a training ground on a flat hilltop.
Between Shiraz and Istakhr is the For-
est of Kamfiruz, an oak forest surrounded 
by pasture land, and the town of Bayda. 
The forest is home to fierce lions, which 
are the terror of the cattle on its pasture.
Kish
The island of Kish is the principal port 
of the Persian Gulf. A great walled city dom-
inates Kish, which lies about 12 miles from 
the coast. Famous in its own right for the 
pearls fished here, Kish throngs with trade 
from Arabia, Africa, and Al-Sindh; products 
are transported to Huzu on the mainland 
and taken north to Shiraz. Kish has risen in 
prominence over the last hundred years or 
so, since the previous port of Siraf further 
west around the coast was destroyed by an 
earthquake that lasted seven days.
Abarkavan
The Long Island is home to pirates and 
raiders, and is the bane of the emir of Kish 
who prefers that the traders coming to his 
port are unmolested. Kish’s lucrative pearl 
fishery banks are also close to Abarkavan, 
and divers risk encounters with the pirates 
whenever they collect their harvest. The pi-
rates have among their number an elemen-
talist (Hedge Magic Revised Edition, Chapter 2) 
who plays havoc with the wind and waves.
Mount Kavarvand
This mountain is home to Adur Farn-
bag, one of the three Royal Fires of Zo-
roastrianism (for the others, see Mihr and 
Takht-i-Suleiman, later). The Royal Fires 
were believed to have been ignited be-
fore creation, and brought forth on the 
King Jamshid
The fourth king to rule the world, 
according to the Shahnameh, Jamshid 
made his capital at Istakhr, which then 
was called Takht-e Jamshed. He was a 
mighty sorcerer who had control over all 
the jinn of the world, and invented armor 
and weapons, weaving and dyeing, ma-
sonry, making wine, and navigation and 
ship-building. He was endowed with the 
royal farr, a shining light that indicated 
the blessing of Ahura Mazda. However, 
he grew to boast of his accomplishments, 
and the farr abandoned him. Without the 
farr, Zahhak (see later) was able to make 
war on him, and Jamshid was brutally 
murdered by the demonic tyrant.
The Jaam-e Jam
The Cup of Jamshid is a silver cup 
ringed seven times with gold and gems. 
For it to work, it must be filled with an 
elixir of immortality. This can be any liq-
uid that grants long life, such as al-Iksir 
(see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman) or a 
Hermetic Longevity Ritual in an appro-
priate form. This liquid must be invented 
afresh each time it is made, and brewed 
specifically for the user of the cup; this 
permits use of the device for one season. 
Once used in the cup, the elixir loses its 
magical properties. When activated, the 
cup allows the bearer to see any place in 
the world, similar to Summoning the Distant 
Image, but without the need for an Arcane 
Connection to the place scried. The user 
needs to merely mention the name of the 
place to be viewed, and an image appears 
in the cup. The Jaam-e Jam can also give 
visions of the heavens, which doubles 
the wielder’s Artes Liberales for astrolog-
ical calculations, and doubles Solomonic 
Astrology for magical workings.
The Cup of Jamshid was used by the 
ancient Persian dynasties right up to the 
Muslim invasion. It was never taken by 
the Arab rulers and remained hidden in Is-
takhr until rediscovered by a sahir several 
years ago.
Story Seed: The Spying Sahir
The sahir in possession of the Cup 
of Jamshid has been using it for petty 
purposes — spying on his neighbors 
and rivals, which may include the char-
acters. In the midst of his nosy scrying, 
he stumbles upon a noted member of the 
community doing something unconscio-
nable, such as binding a sentient being, 
sacrificing to the devil, or something 
similar. There is no way he can reveal 
what he has seen without revealing how, 
and so he must manipulate the charac-
ters through his secret knowledge of 
them, making them uncover the nefari-
ous deeds of the eminent citizen.

back of the ox Srishok to propagate faith 
and protect mankind. Adur Farnbag is to 
be found within a terrestrial Divine re-
gio (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 
13) with an aura of 8. The entrance to 
the regio opens on the west side of the 
mountain every dawn and the east side of 
the mountain every dusk; the pure holy 
fire pours forth from the regio entrance, 
earning Kavarvand the epithet of “the 
shining mountain.”
Adur Farnbag is housed within a Zo-
roastrian fire temple. It is accounted the 
most holy of the three Royal Fires because 
it is seen as the earthly representation of 
the yazata Atar, who burns in the pres-
ence of Ahura Mazda. It was originally 
located in Khwarazm, but later brought 
here by mobeds who still dwell on Ka-
varvand, thanks to the Gifts of Gayomart 
(see Chapter 5: Mythic Zoroastrianism). 
Adur Farnbag represents the priests of 
Ahura Mazda, and anyone who is an er-
vad or higher initiate receives a bonus to 
all Ability and magic rolls equal to their 
Theology: Mazdean Ability while within 
the regio. Mount Kavarvand is a place of 
pilgrimage for Zoroastrians. Any temple 
fire which is lit from a flame deriving from 
Adur Farnbag has its Divine aura increased 
by an additional +1.
Shiraz
Shiraz was made the capital of the 
Persian empire by the Buyid dynasty 
(945–1055), who decorated it with pal-
aces, with mosques, and with the great 
wall that surrounds it. Today, Shiraz is 
famed as a place of learning, home to 
several academies and schools of famous 
poets, and it has been granted the epi-
thet of Dar al-Elm, the House of Knowl-
edge. Its central position in Fars makes it 
a thoroughfare for most of the province’s 
business and trade. It is packed with nar-
row, crowded markets, and boasts three 
great mosques.
Perhaps the most famous structures of 
Shiraz are its many shrines to the imamza-
dihs — the relatives or descendents of the 
twelve Shi’i imams. Each imamzadih can 
grant a different miraculous power (mostly 
regarding healing specific ailments, find-
ing a spouse, or easing childbirth), and the 
shrines vie for the attention of pilgrims 
and visitors.
Shapur
The City of Flowers, as it is sometimes 
known, Shapur’s exports are irises, violets, 
jasmine, narcissuses, and, most notably, the 
red rose of Shapur. Ten different kinds of 
perfumed oil are made in Shapur, made from 
the various flowers of the city. Of these, at-
tar of roses is perhaps the most famous; this 
expensive perfume makes it all the way to 
the courts of England and France.
Yazd
The mountainous region around Yazd 
became the stronghold of Zoroastrianism 
after the coming of Islam to Persia, and 
remains one of the few regions where the 
Mazdean faith is still practiced openly. 
The mountains around Yazd contain six 
holy shrines, or pirs, which form the des-
tinations for yearly communal pilgrimages 
for the Zoroastrian villages, and an excuse 
for feasting and dancing.
The city of Yazd is well-fortified, and 
has two iron gates on the Istakhr road. The 
city is very fertile, thanks to the streams 
that flow from the nearby mountains, and 
it seems like paradise to have such a fertile 
land so close to the Great Deserts. The 
mobeds are held responsible for this mi-
nor miracle.
The Black Man
In a cave near Shapur is a 40-foot-
tall statue of a man carved in black 
stone. At the base of the statue are three 
carved leaves. Some say that the statue 
is carved to represent King Shapur; oth-
ers believe it to have been a real man 
turned to stone by God. The kings of 
Persia’s ancient dynasties used to anoint 
the statue in oils, but none have given 
it homage for many centuries. The cave 
behind the statue has a waterfall, and a 
wind always seems to be blowing from 
its mouth.
The statue is actually a mighty div 
(demon), bound into this statue by a 
mobed many centuries ago. It is believed 
to be one of the 45 named demons 
(Chapter 5: Mythic Zoroastrianism), 
but which one is unknown. Knowing 
he was not powerful enough to bind the 
demon in perpetuity, he fashioned the 
three leaves — originally colored green 
— as a warning of when to repeat the 
binding; as it eroded the color would 
fade from the leaves. In the days of the 
Zoroastrians, the anointment of the 
statue was accompanied by a blessing by 
the mobeds to renew the binding. Since 
the days of Muslim rule this practice was 
abolished as idolatry, and the demon is 
close to being free. Only one tenth of 
one of the leaves remains green.
The Imamzadihs of Shiraz
The shrine of the brother of the 
fourth imam and the shrine to the 
daughter of the sixth imam have a long 
and bitter rivalry. The former is found 
on the Street of Butchers, and is known 
for baraka to cure injuries to the limbs. 
The latter has a much more prominent 
position just off the main square, and 
grants baraka to cure all problems with 
the feet. When a powerful emir is in-
flicted with a painful abscess on his foot, 
devotees of each shrine clamor for his 
attention, knowing the prestige (and 
riches) they will earn from his healing. 
Characters who have been healed at one 
of the shrines might be asked to provide 
testimony, and get caught up in the riots 
when the other shrine tries to disrupt 
the proceedings. The emir might ask 
the characters to determine which of the 
two shrines is the most worthy — or the 
most likely — to cure his complaint.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Jibal
Named “the mountains” (al-jibal) by 
the Arabs, this province is dominated by 
the Zagros mountains which run north-
west to southeast along its southern quar-
ter. Its four great cities (Hamadan, Isfahan, 
Kirmanshah, and Qazvin) have all at one 
time been home to one or more of Persia’s 
dynasties or conquerors, and their fortunes 
have waxed and waned; but at all times the 
largest city Isfahan has flourished. South 
of Hamadan is the emirate of Luristan, the 
home of the Lurs, a semi-nomadic people 
who herd goats in the foothills of the Za-
gros mountains.
The chief road through Jibal — called 
the Khurasan Road — passes from Bagh-
dad to Kirmanshah, then Hamadan, and 
Rayy before heading into Qumis through 
the Caspian Gates. Jibal is one of the 
most densely populated of Persia’s prov-
inces, and has a correspondingly high 
number of sahirs. It is common to see a 
sahir carried aloft on a jinni-made whirl-
wind, or riding one of Isfahan’s famous 
flying carpets, speeding to some impor-
tant engagement.
Isfahan
Arising in the Zagros Mountains to the 
west of Isfahan, the Zayandah River passes 
through the city and flows into the swamp 
of Gav-Khanah on the borders of the Dasht-
i Kavir. Here the river sinks underground 
and emerges 90 leagues away in Kirman, 
where it eventually reaches the sea.
This, the biggest of Jibal’s cities, lies on 
the northern bank of the Zayandah River. 
It is actually a twinned city: to the east is 
Jay, surrounded by a wall with a hundred 
towers, and to the west is Al-Yahudiyah, 
the “town of the Jews,” who have dwelt 
here since the time of Nebuchadnezzar. 
The noted physician Ibn Sina (known as 
Avicenna in the West) lived and taught 
here. Isfahan exports silk and cotton, as 
well as saffron and all kinds of fruit, but it 
is for its carpets — the famed Persian rug 
— that Isfahan is best known.
Kargas Kuh  
and Siyah Kuh
The “Vulture Hills” and “Black Hills” 
are the highest points on the plain of Per-
sia: black, evil-looking mountains, and fa-
mous hiding-places for robbers. Between 
the two mountain ranges is the caravan-
serai of Dayr al-Jiss, where, by order of 
the Sultan, four great tanks are kept full 
of water to supply travelers crossing the 
Dasht-i Kavir.
Kirmanshah
This is the seat of the semi-indepen-
dent province of Kurdistan, which was 
created in about 1150 by Sultan San-
Persian Rugs
A famed export from all over Persia 
is the intricately woven carpet or rug, 
and the center of excellence in Persia 
is Isfahan. A traditional Isfahan rug has 
an ivory-colored field bearing a single 
central medallion surrounded by leaves 
and vines. Vibrant hues of blue, rose, and 
indigo are employed using dyeing tech-
niques that are a closely guarded secret 
of the Isfahani weavers.
There are several weavers of magical 
carpets in Isfahan; these craftsmen most-
ly have the Touched by Magic Major 
Virtue (City & Guild, page 72). This Virtue 
allows a weaver to make a magical carpet 
by adding the magnitude of the magical 
effect and the Uses per Day modifier to 
the basic Craft Total of 12. Each weaver 
can only instill magical effects which 
cover two Hermetic Forms. A magical 
carpet only ever operates for the person 
for whom it was made.
The two most famous weavers are 
Dadvand and Yarankush. Dadvand is a 
manufacturer of the famed flying car-
pet. Dadvand’s family have been making 
these carpets since the time of the Sasa-
nids, and they have patrons among the 
Suhhar Sulayman. These are exception-
ally expensive due to the skill required 
to make them. Dadvand makes other 
magical rugs as well, such as ones that 
promote an aura of health which speeds 
recovery from wounds.
Yarankush is known for making car-
pets which protect their owner. He spe-
cializes in rugs that let out a loud noise 
when they are stepped on by anyone 
other than their owner, and in these days 
of secret murder such carpets are a boon 
to any powerful man. Unknown to all, 
Yarankush is a member of the Isma’ili as-
sassin sect (see later), and in the design 
of the carpet he hides a secret warning 
so that they know not to step on it. Since 
advertising that one has a Yarankush rug 
defeats the point of having one, this has 
not affected Yarankush’s sales.
Dadvand’s Steed of the Air
Twice per day, this heavy woolen car-
pet can lift off the ground and transport 
its owner, and everything he is carrying, 
through the air as fast as a horse can run.

Murderers’ Chagrin
Twice per day, the owner can acti-
vate the warning function of this carpet. 
As long as he remains in contact with 
the carpet (sleeping or sitting on it, for 
example), any other individual touching 
the carpet causes it to emit a loud sound 
for a round; each carpet produces a dif-
ferent noise. CrIm 3 (Base 1, +1 Touch,

jar for his nephew. Kirmanshah boasts 
a great mosque and a sumptuous palace. 
About a day’s march east of Kirmanshah 
are the sculptures of Bustam, carved into 
the black rock of the mountainside. These 
depict King Darius receiving tribute from 
his subject kings, and the much later 
sculptures of King Khursaw Parviz and 
Queen Shirin, whose story is well known 
— Shirin was loved by the sculptor Far-
had, who killed himself in despair for his 
love of her.
Kanguvar
Kanguvar, called Kasr-al Lusus, the 
Robber’s Castle, by the Arabs, lies near to 
the road heading east from Kirmanshah; 
it is so named because of the larcenous 
activities of its inhabitants. Travelers are 
well-advised to count their fingers and 
toes after passing through Kanguvar.
Qum
Perhaps the second most holy place to 
Islam in Persia after Mashhad, Qum bears 
a shrine to the Fatima, sister of Imam Reza 
(see Mashhad, later). Buried with her are 
the three daughters of the ninth imam. 
Reza once told the faithful that a pilgrim-
age to his sister’s tomb would assure en-
trance to Paradise.
A few miles east of Qum is the mosque 
of Jam Karan. In 986 Hassan ibn Muthih 
was visited by the Imam of the Ages and 
the prophet al-Khidr, and told to build 
a mosque on the sacred ground of Jam 
Karan. The mosque built at his direction 
is virtually unequaled in Persia in terms 
of architecture and embellishment. The 
mosque has a Dominion aura of 7.
Rayy
The city of Rayy is strongly fortified, 
and has five gates over the five roads that 
radiate from here — to Hamadan, Qazvin, 
Mazandaran, Khurasan, and Qum. The in-
ner city, containing the mosque and the 
houses of the bureaucrats, is surrounded 
by a ditch. The outer city surrounds and 
overlooks the inner city, and has a promi-
nent fruit market selling melons, peaches, 
apricots, and so forth. It also exports blue-
dyed cotton, particularly as striped cloth, 
and hardwood taken from the Mazanda-
ran forests.
On a nearby mountain there is a shrine 
dedicated to Shahr Banu, a Sasanid prin-
cess and mother of the fourth Shi’i imam. 
Legend has it that the princess was swal-
lowed by the mountain rather than allow-
ing her enemies to kill her. For centuries 
before there had been a shrine here dedi-
cated to Anahita, the Mazdean yazata of 
water and fertility. The spring at the shrine 
is a source of Aquam vis, if the water is col-
lected when Venus is in the sky.
Savah
The people of Savah are camel-drivers 
and herders, but the great mosque of Sa-
vah contains a magical library unequaled 
in Persia. Attached to the town’s mosque 
is a hospital and a tall domed tower, which 
houses the library on its lower floors and 
an observatory at its top. The tower is 
staffed by Savah’s House of Wisdom, all of 
whom are members of the Ashab al-Najm 
(see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman). The 
observatory of Savah is world-renowned, 
containing innumerable star maps ranging 
from ancient Babylonia to the current day, 
and the state-of-the-art in astronomical in-
struments. In addition to having a Magic 
aura of 5, the observatory grants a +3 bo-
nus to any astrology rolls, including use of 
Solomonic Astrology.
The current Asala of the Ashab al-
Najm hails from Savah, a wizened old man 
named Meriq al-Asala al-Qalani al-Safar 
al-Najm. He is mostly known for wearing 
a strange hat that looks like it is inside-out, 
and joking that his hat does not sit on his 
head, but rather that his head sits on his 
hat. After the previous Asala left in 1186 
(see Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia, Na-
sibin), Meriq stepped forward to represent 
the family, to general acceptance by the

other astrologer-viziers at the Majlis, who 
consulted the heavens. Many of them now 
think he does not take the responsibil-
ity seriously enough, but do not feel they 
should ask him to step down. He does not 
have The Gift, but is nonetheless a gifted 
communicator and has written many ex-
cellent books on Artes Liberales and Solo-
monic Astrology, among other subjects.
Takht-i-Suleiman
The “Throne of Solomon” is located in 
a semi-circular valley in the mountains of 
Jibal. At the summit of a small, flat-topped 
hill is a small but deep lake fed by an un-
derwater spring. On its shores is a remark-
ably well-preserved Mazdean fire temple, 
whose walls are co-terminal with a terres-
trial Divine regio of aura 8. The regio is 
the resting place of Adur Gushnasp, one 
of the three Royal Fires of Zoroastrian be-
lief (see Mount Kavarvand earlier for more 
details of the Royal Fires). Adur Gushnasp 
is particularly attuned to warriors and no-
bles, and a weapon made in a forge lit from 
Adur Gushnap and quenched in the waters 
of the lake receives a +4 bonus to invok-
ing God’s aid in battle (Realms of Power: The 
Divine, page 41) whenever the warrior for 
whom it was made uses that weapon. This 
bonus lasts for a number of years equal to 
the wielder’s Theology: Mazdean Ability. 
The weapon loses all power permanently 
if used by another.
Khuzistan
Khuzistan is the most ancient inhab-
ited area in Persia, once known as Elam 
in the days of old Babylon. Khuzistan oc-
cupies the watershed of the great Karun 
River, which starts in the Zagros moun-
tains, and Khuzistan’s well-watered plains 
are used to grow sugar cane. Its many riv-
ers have been canalized to serve the fields 
and the towns, and all are navigable by 
boat. The northern reaches of the prov-
ince are home to the semi-nomadic Lurs 
(who also occupy southern Jibal). Khuz-
istan is ruled by a Ghuzz atabeg of the 
Hazarasp family who has sworn loyalty 
to the Khwarazm-shah.
Ahwaz
The capital of the province of Khuzistan, 
Ahwaz is plagued by jinn who cause it to be 
unbearably hot during the day, and swarm-
ing with biting flies at night. The crashing 
of the waterbound jinn over Ahwaz’s weir 
keeps those not used to it up at night, and 
the fields around the city are plagued with 
all manner of snakes and scorpions.
Gundeshapur
The city of Gundeshapur is home 
to the great medical school and hospital 
known as the House of Healing. It was 
founded by the sahir Bakhtyshu, a Nesto-
rian Christian and one of members of the 
wise council of Harun that reformed the 
Suhhar Sulayman. His descendents still 
run the school, which was funded by the 
Seljuk Sultans and has remained in high 
regard with the Khwarazm-shah. Unsur-
prisingly, the House of Healing is also 
Gundeshapur’s largest bayt al-hikma. It 
is a palatial building near the center of 
town, with doors open to every direction 
and covered porches of canvas held up by 
wooden columns on all four sides. It has 
many windows depicting the stories of 
the members of the First Council, though 
many locals mistakenly believe them to 
depict Christian legends, and a great hall 
surrounded by an outer corridor (much 
like a cloister). The whole house is inside 
a Divine aura, which the sahirs must work 
around by digging out laboratories deep 
beneath the ground where there are many 
buried pockets of Magic power, and these 
rooms are connected with the common 
area by long, narrow ladders.
The vizier currently representing the 
bayt at Gundeshapur is Nil al-Wazir al-
Salih al-Yad, a sahir of Christian descent 
who converted to Islam after joining the 
Suhhar. Many believe that he maintains 
a dangerously close association with the 
sahir sect called the Nizaris (see The 
Nizari Isma’ili State, later), members of 
which have occasionally visited him at 
the famous House of Healing. The Ashab 
al-Yad have always had a poor reputation 
in the Suhhar, however, and Nil has never 
seemed particularly troubled by these ac-
cusations at Majlis. He is said to be a great 
historian, very knowledgeable about past 
events of the Middle East, and also well-
versed in European history. He is not es-
pecially skilled at Solomonic Medicine, as 
others of his family might expect him to 
be, but instead seems to prefer the art of 
Solomonic Storytelling, and is said to have 
an enchanting singing voice.
Ramhurmuz
A rich town that makes its living from 
silk and perfume, Ramhurmuz also boasts a 
modest library. The sahirs of Ramhurmuz 
in the past made contact with one of the fa-
bled sorcerers of Soqotra (see Rival Magic). 
For several years the exotic wizard studied 
with them and they exchanged ideas; but 
in his naivety he gave away many of the 
secrets of his island, including the recipes 
for many perfumes which the sahirs made 
into a commercial success. When he real-
ized that he had been duped, the sorcerer 
left, but not before laying a fearful curse 
on the district, which every year is inun-
dated with gnats and biting midges.
The Alchemist of Ahwaz
There is an alchemist who claims to 
be able to turn base metals into gold who 
lives in Ahwaz. He needs a few magical 
ingredients to effect this change, and 
promises to share his yield with charac-
ters if they help him get the supplies he 
needs. Key among these ingredients is 
the wood collected by the gryphons that 
live in the Zagros mountains for their 
nests. However, he intends to abandon 
his helpers to the mercy of the gryphons, 
so as to safeguard his secret recipe.

The Cradle & The Crescent
District of the Zutt
The Zutt are a tribe that dwells to 
the southeast of Ramhurmuz, close to 
the border with Fars. They are a semi-
nomadic people who claim to originate 
from beyond Al-Sind, and they travel in 
wagons richly painted with vibrant de-
signs. The Zutt themselves favor flam-
boyant colors in their dress, utilizing 
delicate silks and heavily-dyed linen. 
The Zutt have a reputation for larceny, 
and the Khuzistani are usually hostile to 
them when they arrive in town to trade. 
Zutt women are known for being power-
ful Folk Witches (Hedge Magic Revised Edi-
tion, Chapter 3).
Occasionally the Zutt wander further 
afield, and have been encountered Egypt 
and in Samarkand. Furthermore, some of 
the covenfolk of Atsingani (see The Lion and 
the Lily, page 76) bear a close resemblance 
to the Zutt.
Kirman
Kirman, although technically part of 
Persia, has a history of remaining virtu-
ally independent. The Ghuzz had ruled 
the region since invading across the des-
ert fifty years ago, but their authority 
has disintegrated under their notorious 
inability to be ruled themselves, and the 
Ghuzz have entered into the ranks of the 
Khwarazm-shah’s army, which now occu-
pies Kirman.
Kirman is mostly steppe and semi-des-
ert, and is famous for its oranges, dates, 
and pistachios. It is the home to several 
secretive communities of Mazdeans, who 
try to not draw attention to themselves, 
for they have been heavily persecuted in 
the past. A quarter of the province is taken 
up by the Jabal Kufs, mountains found to 
the south of the Dasht-i Lut.
Bardasir
The city of Bardasir is an important 
trading center, set between the west of 
Persia and Khurasan. Outside the town 
on a very tall hill is the provincial gov-
ernor’s palace, set amid lush gardens. 
The city is guarded by a second fortress 
at the gate, and a third castle overlooks 
the houses from the center of the city. 
Despite all this military might, Bardasir 
was still sacked during the Ghuzz inva-
sion, and it has been overtaken by Sirjan 
in importance.
Jiruft
This city lies on the Div Rud — the 
“Demon River” — that thunders with such 
force that waterwheels throughout the city 
supply power to the processing of indigo, 
cotton, and grain. The forests around 
Jiruft are home to lions, and the city is un-
der siege from the fierce creatures. Anyone 
approaching the city must brave the deep-
shadowed forests, and trade with the out-
side has dried to a trickle in recent years. 
The lions of Jiruft are ruled by a jinni, who 
took over the pride about a decade ago. 
Since he extended his glamour over the

Mazandaran
This is the collective name given to 
the provinces between the Caspian Sea 
and the Alborz mountains. Gilan is the 
easternmost province (see Chapter 7: 
Mythic Mesopotamia), with Daylam to 
its south, then Tabaristan further west 
(whose chief city is Amul), then Gur-
gan in the far west (whose capital is also 
called Gurgan). During the Muslim con-
quest of Persia, Mazandaran was never 
taken, partly due to its protection by the 
Alborz mountains to the south and partly 
due to the strong resistance put forth by 
its aristocratic Mazdean families. The Ba-
vand family remained in control of Ma-
zandaran for 200 years, before they were 
eventually brought down by the Nizari 
Isma’ilis (see later) in 1125, who are now 
dominant in the region.
Mazandaran was known to the ancient 
world as Hyrcania, a land famous for its ti-
gers (see insert). The region is exception-
ally fertile with a tropical climate, and the 
Zoroastrians believe that it was especially 
blessed by Ahura Mazda. Unlike most of 
Persia, houses in Mazandaran are usually 
built of wood rather than brick, and it is 
The Balu Tribesmen
The Jabal Kufs are occupied by 
Balu tribesmen who are greatly feared 
by the Persians. Travelers’ tales recount 
that they use rocks to stone their vic-
tims to death in order not to needlessly 
blunt their swords. They are rumored to 
need neither food nor drink, and to have 
the tireless nature of their war-camels. 
The Balu detest the Ghuzz, but con-
sider them worthy enemies to use their 
swords upon.
The Balu have a strong dose of Jinni 
Blood (Chapter 3: The Jinn), and very of-
ten have the Greater Immunity to Thirst 
Virtue. They are usually accompanied 
by their jinn kinsmen on their raids, and 
they have wise men who possess Faerie 
Summoning and Bonding (see Realms of 
Power: Faerie, pages 131–133). Their war 
leaders are occasionally bonded to des-
ert or mountain jinni, allowing them ac-
cess to their faerie powers.
Story Seed: The Lion-Shah
When the lion-shah hears that the 
lions of Kamfiruz in Fars (see Istakhr, 
earlier) are being persecuted by the lo-
cal emir, he asks the characters to pro-
tect them, and if possible, bring them 
to Jiruft so that they may be safe. In 
return, he offers his gratitude and that 
of the lions; this could prove a valu-
able commodity to a sahir or to an ani-
mal trainer.

The Cradle & The Crescent
particularly famed for an exotic hardwood 
called khalanj.
Mazandaran is a magical battleground 
between three factions of magicians. First, 
in the southwest is Daylam, which is one 
of the few strongholds of Zoroastrianism 
remaining in Persia. Second are the Nizari 
Isma’ilis, who have strongholds in the Al-
borz mountains and dominate the politi-
cal scene in Mazandaran. Finally, there are 
the yatus of Mount Damavand. The mem-
bers of these three groups clash regularly. 
All three groups have deep religious con-
victions that they will never agree upon, 
and Isma’ilism in particular is a prosely-
tizing faith which seeks to unite all men 
under its banner, and remove those who 
refuse to convert. Furthermore, the yatus 
and the Nizaris fight over vis sources, the 
mobeds and Nizari fight to influence or 
control the local rulers, and the mobeds 
detest the yatus for their paganism and 
presumed diabolism.
Daylam
This highland region resides in Gi-
lan and Mazandaran, but may as well be 
a country in its own right. At the height 
of its power in the tenth century, Daylam 
encompassed all of Gilan, Tabaristan, Gur-
gan, and Qumis; now all of these provinc-
es are under separate rule, and Daylam is 
identified culturally rather than geograph-
ically or politically. The Alborz mountains 
isolate Daylam from the Persian plateau, 
and it is inhabited by a fiercely indepen-
dent people who resisted the rule of the 
Sasanids and the Arabs. The Daylami 
were one of the last peoples in Persia to 
accept Islam, and Zoroastrianism is still 
relatively strong here, existing uncomfort-
ably alongside Isma’ili Islam. The Nizari 
Isma’ilis hold fifty castles in Daylam, of 
which the chief is Alamut (see later), the 
strongest is Maimun-Diz, and the most re-
mote is Lamasar.
Qumis
The province of Qumis lies at the east-
ern Alborz mountains south of Tabaristan. 
Its chief settlement is the city of Damghan, 
which is virtually the only non-Isma’ili 
settlement in the province. The emir of 
Qumis is under siege in his own land, and 
he treads very carefully so as to not up-
set his subjects, never knowing which of 
them is a Nizari. Isma’ili efforts in Qumis 
Hyrcanian Vis
Vis is plentiful in the lush and fertile 
lands of Mazandaran. The yatus attribute 
this to Mount Damavand, believing it 
to be the source of all vis in the world, 
whereas the Daylami mobeds consider it 
part of Ahura Mazda’s bounty. 
Vis commonly accumulates in the 
unique or unusual in Mazandaran: for 
example, if a chicken lays three brown 
eggs and one white, the white one con-
tains vis. In a field of wheat, it is the ear 
that has thirteen grains that has the vis. 
The furthest piece of driftwood on the 
Caspian shore might also contain vis. 
Characters can spend time search-
ing for vis by following up on rumors 
gleaned from locals, and the hunter can 
expect to follow blind alleys or find 
that the vis has already gone. Searching 
for vis takes a base time of one season, 
and the character must travel through 
an area the size of a small county. Make 
a Perception + Area Lore: Mazandaran 
roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Success 
indicates a pawn of vis. For every point 
in excess of the Ease Factor, either an-
other pawn of vis is found, or the time 
taken is halved. These can be combined 
in the case of a good roll; for example, 
a character who makes the roll by 8 
may take 11 days (halving four times) 
to find five pawns of vis. Renewable 
sources of vis cannot be found using 
this method; those should result from 
stories instead.

Further, if Magic Lore is not used, 
half of the vis found (rounded up) is

the Lore used.
The storyguide can adjust the Ease 
Factor according to the density of local 
magicians or magical creatures. For ex-
ample, if another sahir has searched in 
the region in the previous year, then the 
–3 penalty from the table is appropriate, 
even if the character has not searched 
here recently. At the storyguide’s option, 
this mechanic can be used to find vis in 
other regions (with the appropriate Area 
Lore), although the yield is typically 
lower. The Ease Factor would be 12 for a 
typical wilderness region, 15 in a settled 
area, and 18 in a city. 
Most sahirs living in the region — 
whether of yatu or Nizari training — dis-
cover or are granted a Personal Vis Source 
(as per the Virtue) early in their career.

are coordinated from the great mountain 
stronghold of Girdkuh. Girdkuh charges a 
toll on all travelers through Qumis, since 
it is on the only route between western 
Persia and Khurasan that does not cross 
the Great Desert.
The Great  
Wall of Gurgan
This immense fortification stretches 
from the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea 
eastwards and north to end in the Pishka-
mar Mountains. The wall is over 120 miles 
in length, with 35 forts placed approximate-
ly every 30 miles. The wall is 25 feet wide, 
about 20 feet tall, and has a central canal 
carrying water throughout its entire length. 
It is made of red bricks, reinforced by steel 
and adamantine — an unbreakable metal 
made from diamonds by certain magicians. 
There is a Magic aura of 5 along the length 
of the wall. Legend holds that the wall was 
built on the order of Alexander the Great 
(and thus is sometimes called Sadd-i-Iksandar, 
the dam of Alexander) to keep the descen-
dents of Gog and Magog from entering Per-
sia. In this purpose it seems to have failed, 
for the Ghuzz (see earlier) entered Persia a 
century ago, and were invited to stay.
One of the reasons it might have failed 
to repel the Ghuzz is a breach in the wall, 
at the closest fort to the Gates of Alex-
ander, which mark the western terminus 
of the wall close to the Caspian shore. 
No one knows how recent the breach 
is, but since its discovery the local sahirs 
have noted the lack of the aura alignment 
(Realms of Power: Magic, page 16) that used 
to mark the Wall of Gurgan, in that spells 
The Caspian Gates
Through the province of Qumis 
runs the road from Rayy to Nishapur. 
This road passes through the Caspian 
Gates, or Sirdara to the Persians. The 
“gates” are an interminable narrow 
gorge cutting through the mountains; 
carts can only advance in single file 
between the vertical cliff faces, and 
progress is hindered further by the 
water pouring down the rocks and the 
swarms of serpents that haunt the area. 
Merchants still risk the road in pref-
erence to taking the route across the 
Great Desert.

ReAn 20 (Base 20, by analogy with 
ReCo) Personal Power (20 levels, –1 
Might cost)
Vis: 2 pawns Animal, in feet.
Appearance: The Hyrcanian tiger is a 
long-legged tawny cat, about 7 feet 
long (including a 3 foot tail), and 
weighing about 150 pounds. Tigers 
in Mythic Europe have spots rather 
than stripes, although naturally you 
can have striped tigers in your saga 
if you prefer. 
Hyrcanian Tigers are found in Mazan-
daran and Persia’s northern desert. The ti-
ger is named after its swift flight (coming 
from a word meaning “arrow”), and gives 
its name to the Tigris River. The ancient 
Persian kings loved keeping Hyrcanian 
tigers as pets, and even today the nobil-
ity set hunters to steal cubs to be trained 
for the hunt. The pursuing mother can be 
distracted by glass spheres; on seeing her 
own reflection she thinks it is her cub and 
is cheated from her revenge. 
The tiger receives a +3 to all rolls in-
volving running. 
For a mundane version of this crea-
ture, remove the Might score, Magi-
cal Qualities, Powers, and vis from the 
earlier description. A Hyrcanian tiger is 
more than twice as swift than the fastest 
horse, even without magical powers, but 
can normally only sustain such speeds 
for one or two rounds. Its prey’s only 
hope of escape is to dodge and weave, 
since the Hyrcanian tiger cannot make 
sharp turns when traveling at full speed. 
It is in the magical tiger’s nature to hunt, 
and it consumes its prey — principally 
gazelles — even though, as a magic ani-
mal, it doesn’t need this to survive.

The Cradle & The Crescent
directed against giants used to receive 
twice the normal aura bonus. It is obvious 
to anyone who inspects it that the breach 
was intentional, and there is evidence of 
non-Solomonic magic used to enforce the 
gap in the wall’s protection. The sahirs of 
Mazandaran have showed little interest in 
repairing the breach since the Ghuzz are 
of no current threat to them.
Mount Damavand
This distinctive mountain dominates 
the whole of Tabaristan, and its snow-
capped summit is visible for hundreds of 
miles across the plains of Persia. Dama-
vand is the home of the Simurgh, and the 
evil tyrant Zahhak is believed to be im-
prisoned below the mountain. There are 
seven settlements on the lower slopes of 
the mountain, each one with its own bayt 
al-hikma composed of mostly yatu-de-
scended sahirs (see insert).
The Great 
Desert
Although referred to as a single des-
ert — the Great Desert, or Al-Mafazah 
(“The Wilderness”) — Persia’s central 
dry lands are composed of two distinct 
regions, called Dasht-i Kavir in the north 
and Dasht-i Lut in the south. The Great 
Desert belongs to no province; it is a no-
Story Seed: Sealing the Breach
The characters are aware of a threat to 
Persia’s security, whether from the Mon-
gols, from a Zahhak, or from an enemy 
yet to reveal itself. They learn the yatus of 
Damavand are the guardians of an initia-
tion script that grants the Major Magical 
Focus of “Enemies of Persia,” but it can 
only be performed in the aligned aura of 
the Wall of Gurgan. The characters must 
try to repair the breach in the wall, which 
might involve going head-to-head with 
whatever supernatural foe caused it.
The Simurgh
The Simurgh is an immense bird that 
lives on Mount Damavand, although she 
makes expeditions to all corners of Persia 
and most of its inhabitants have seen her 
at some point. The people of Persia are 
oddly comforted by her presence, as she 
is a bringer of fertility as well as a sym-
bol of national pride. The Simurgh is so 
old that she claims to have seen the de-
struction of the world three times over. 
During her exceptionally long life she 
has accumulated wisdom, and she is an 
authority on many subjects. In her most 
famous legend, the simurgh adopted the 
albino Zal (the father of Rostam), when 
he was abandoned by his father in the 
Alborz mountains. Zal learnt much from 
the Simurgh, and when he left her she 
gave him three of her feathers, with 
which he could summon her in need.
The Simurgh is so large that nor-
mal weapons are as nothing to her. It 
requires magical weapons or spells to 
cause wounds. She may grant a worthy 
character one of her breast feathers us-
ing her External Vis Virtue; each one 
contains five pawns of vis. These feathers 
are Arcane Connections to the Simurgh, 
and can be used to summon her in times 
of great need by casting them into a fire.
The Simurgh is not designed to be a 
player character.

man’s-land where outlaws find shelter 
and there are no permanent villages ex-
cept for the three oases. The roads that 
join towns on opposite sides of the Great 
Desert have water tanks and domes built 
every three to four leagues, and it is in 
the best interests of merchants to keep 
these tanks full. Both deserts are the 
haunt of jinn.
Dasht-i Kavir
This salt desert is found to the north 
of Persia’s central plateau. It is about 500 
miles west to east, and about 200 miles 
north to south. Although the center of 
the desert receives virtually no rainfall, 
there are marshes, wadis, and steppe-like 
regions within the Dasht-i Kavir, and 
in the west a great salt lake. Unlike the 
Dasht-i Lut (see later), the Dasht-i Ka-
vir is home to many birds, such as the 
ubiquitous sand grouse and the impres-
sively large bustard, as well as the fabled 
Persian gazelle and the Hyrcanian tigers 
who hunt it.
Garmah
In the center of the Dasht-i Kavir, 
halfway between Isfahan and Tabas, is 
one of the three oases of the Great Des-
ert. It consists of three hamlets camped 
around a small fort, some palm trees, and 
pasture where cattle can forage. The emir 
of the fort is charged with keeping the 
desert routes clear for merchants and 
other travelers.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Naband are notorious hiding places for 
desert raiders.
Dasht-i Lut
The “emptiness desert” is approximate-
ly 300 miles along its northwest-to-south-
east axis and 200 miles wide. The eastern 
part of the Dasht-i Lut is a low plateau 
of salt flats. The southeast is principally 
sandy. Unlike the Dasht-i Kavir, animal 
and plant life is much more scarce in the 
southern desert.
Gandom Beriyan
The central portion of the Dasht-i Lut 
is called Gandom Beriyan (“the toasted 
wheat”). It is a volcanic wasteland covered 
in black lava. It is the most treacherous 
of terrains, riddled with ravines and sink-
holes, and blasted by a terrifically strong 
wind. The Gandom Beriyan is the hottest 
place in Persia, and is completely devoid 
of animal or plant life. 
The Gandom Beriyan is, however, the 
home of the most malicious and evil of the 
jinn tribes, since an Infernal aura of 4 cov-
ers this area. The aura is corrupted with 
a Debauched aura of exhaustion (Realms of 
Power: The Infernal, page 14) that prevents 
anyone from spending Confidence points 
while here. At the heart of the Gandom 
Beriyan is the entrance to a Tartaran re-
gio with an Aura of 7 where the air itself 
burns, and the rock is molten. One of the 
most powerful corrupt jinn in Persia lurks 
in this regio.
Sanij
The southernmost oasis of the Great 
Desert, Sanij links Kirman with Seistan. 
The Balu tribesmen (see Kirman, earlier) 
know this valley oasis well, and are a con-
stant threat to the sizable population that 
lives here.
Makran
This coastal province gets its name 
from mahi khoran, meaning “eaters of fish” in 
Parsi. It is sparsely populated, with most of 
the population concentrated in small fish-
ing villages. The capital of the province is 
Fannazbur, but it is a poor town compared 
to the mighty cities of other provinces. 
The port of Tiz is a stopping point between 
Al-Sind in the east and Fars in the west. 
In the past, Makran was the battleground 
between the Arab caliphs and the kings of 
Al-Sind, and war elephants captured from 
the latter in battle were integrated into 
the Persian army. Bands of Ghuzz roam 
through Makran, having once been part of 
the invasion force that occupied Kirman.
The Gedrosian Desert
O Commander of the faithful! It’s a 
land where the plains are stony; Where 
water is scanty; Where the fruits are unsa-
vory; Where men are known for treachery; 
Where plenty is unknown; Where virtue 
is held of little account; And where evil is 
dominant; A large army is small for there; 
And a small army is useless there; The land 
beyond it, is even worse… 
	
— Messenger to Caliph Umar, 
	
     644 AD
Famous for its impassibility, the desert 
of Makran has fought at least three great 
ancient armies in the past: that of Cyrus 
the Great, the legions of Queen Semiramis, 
and finally the previously unconquered 
veterans of Alexander the Great. Known as 
Gedrosia to the ancients, the arid coastal 
region is inhabited by scattered fisherfolk. 
The region contains an incredibly 
large number of pagan ghosts, soldiers 
from the armies that have died since antiq-
uity attempting to cross its arid expanse. 
As restless dead, these spirits are readily 
susceptible to the summons of necroman-
cers and other summoners, although most 
are overwhelmed with the emotions of de-
spair and memories of deprivation and are 
unable to provide much useful information 
about their past.
Why Go to Hell?
It is difficult to imagine why char-
acters would ever come to Gandom 
Beriyan. However, there are a few 
reasons why they might. It is a place 
of Infernal pilgrimage, and a group of 
characters might chase a villain here 
before he can dedicate himself more 
fully to the path of Hell. Characters 
might accidentally stumble upon it 
while fleeing from the Balu tribesman; 
if this occurs, they may find them-
selves being rescued by their pursuers, 
who are loathe to allow the land more 
victims than is necessary. Alternative-
ly, as the hottest place on earth, the 
Gandom Beriyan might be important 
in a mystery initiation, or as a place to 
forge or destroy an item of power.
The Rig-i Jinn
An area of sand dunes in the central 
Dasht-i Kavir is home to a tribe of jinn. 
The Rig-i Jinn is avoided by the traders 
who cross the desert, but the jinn, while 
mischievous, are not malicious. The 
Rig-i Jinn is found within a Faerie Aura 
of 3, but it is an extension of the glam-
our of the tribe, and moves when they 
do. Travelers encountering the jinn spy 
a lush oasis where there should be none. 
They may encounter either hospitality 
or hostility depending on the mood of 
the jinn, but whether they are given 
food and drink or wounds, the oasis 
will have moved during the encounter, 
and when the faeries retreat, the charac-
ters could be tens of leagues away from 
where they started.

Seistan
Seistan is a lowland country around and 
east of Lake Zarah, into which several major 
rivers drain. Like Quhistan and Ghur, Seistan 
is a dependency of Khurasan. In the Shahn-
ameh, Seistan is called Zabulistan, famous as 
the home of Zal and his son Rostam, a man 
of both heroic proportions and heroic repu-
tation. Seistan is home to many Ghuzz.
Dartal
The city of Dartal is located in the Za-
min-Dawar, the “Land of Gates,” referring 
to the passes into the mountains of Ghur. 
Dartal is heavily garrisoned with horse 
guards as protection against the warlike 
Ghurs on the other side of the mountains. 
Flocks in the Zamin-Dawar is the source 
of much of Persia’s wool.
Rostam
Rostam is the legendary hero of the Per-
sian race. He was a giant so big his mother 
struggled to give birth, and his father had 
to be taught to perform a caesarian section 
by the Simurgh. His constant companion 
was Rakhsh, a stallion big enough to bear 
his weight, fierce enough to kill a lion, 
and twice as swift as any other horse. The 
best-known tales of Rostam are Haft Khan-e 
Rostam and Rostam and Sohrab. In Haft Khan-e 
Rostam (Rostam’s Seven Quests), he jour-
neys to rescue his king from the clutches 
of the demons of Mazandaran. The story 
ends with an epic battle between Rostam 
and the Div-e Sepid (“White Demon”). In 
Rostam and Sohrab, Rostam mistakenly kills 
his own son Sohrab in battle. Rostam was 
eventually killed through the treachery of 
the king he served. 
The legend of Rostam can be inte-
grated into a saga in a number of ways, 
and some ideas are given later. So famous 
is it that any Persian character is likely to 
know the story of Rostam without an ap-
propriate Ability roll, but precise details 
should be left to those with an appropri-
ate Area Lore.
Mythic Blood: Rostam
A magus who hails from the line of 
Rostam has great physical prowess. He 
can grant himself a +3 bonus to any one 
type of physical action that is a specialty 
of the Athletics, Ride, or Swim Abilities 
(e.g., climbing, running, riding at speed, 
diving, swimming long distances, etc.). 
Each time this power is used, a different 
physical action can be selected; the bo-
nus lasts for two minutes, and the power 
cannot be used again until the previous 
bonus’s duration has expired (ReCo 25: 
base 10, +1 Diam, +2 flexibility). The 
Minor Magical Focus that accompanies 
this bloodline is Damaging Supernatural 
Creatures, and the Personality Flaw is 
Reckless (born mostly from stubborn-
ness rather than heroism). It is likely that 
the character has either the Large or the 
Giant Blood Virtue.
Rostam’s  
Tiger Skin and Mace
Rostam’s Tiger Skin was worn over 
his armor, and he used it as a blanket 
when adventuring. It grants a Soak bo-
nus of +5 that is cumulative with any 
other armor, and it has a Load of 1. It 
makes its possessor a very deep sleeper; 
the character can always recover Long 
Term Fatigue levels from a night’s sleep, 
even if it is on hard ground or unpleas-
antly cold. However, a Stamina roll 
against an Ease Factor of 9 is required 
to rouse the character from sleep at all, 
and when woken the character has a 
–1 penalty to all actions until the sun 
rises. These effects can be thrown off by 
spending a Confidence point. The tiger 
skin is currently in the possession of the 
emir of Ghur.
Rostam’s Mace is a two-handed 
mace (treat as a warhammer, ArM5, 
page 176) of superlative craftsman-
ship, and grants +3 to both Attack and 
Defense Totals. While held, the mace 
grants the wielder the effects of the In-
spirational Virtue. It was taken to Turan 
(Transoxiana) by Rostam’s enemies 
after his death, and is currently in Sa-
markand, lying forgotten in one of the 
tombs in the Shahr-i-Zindah.
It is said that reuniting the mace 
and the tiger skin with the body of 
Rostam will rouse the hero from his 
deathlike sleep — albeit temporarily 
— and cause him to stride afresh to 
Persia’s defense. Once the threat from 
the east becomes apparent (see Chap-
ter 9: The Silk Road, Genghis Khan), 
Persian sahirs may well consider that 
the resurrection of their greatest hero is 
worth the trouble. A quest in the story 
of Rostam in Elysium (Realms of Power: 
Faerie, page 34) may grant clues to the 
location of the two items.
The Idol of Zur
At the time of the Muslim conquest, 
a fabulous idol was taken as booty from 
the Zur Mountain near Dartal. It was 
made of solid gold, and had rubies for 
eyes. For the last few hundred years it 
has been owned by a succession of no-
tables, but is now in the possession of 
a Zutt family (see Khuzistan, earlier). 
Whether through its own power or that 
of the Zutt matriarch, the idol has the 
ability to move, and has been walking 
in the direction of Zur for the last few 
years. The characters encounter the 
Zutt family following the two-foot idol 
as it slowly makes its way to Zur. What 
will happen if it is permitted to return to 
its shrine is unknown, but could either 
be very good, or very, very bad.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Zaranj
The capital of Seistan is Zaranj, built 
on a branch of the great Helmund River; 
during flood time the city is perilously 
close to the shores of Lake Zarah as it 
swells dramatically in size. The city has 
an inner town surrounded by a wall, be-
yond which are the suburbs of the outer 
town. All the houses have running water 
thanks to above-ground channels, and 
they nearly all have cellars in which the 
inhabitants live in the oppressive heat of 
the summer. Within Zaranj is a fluted tow-
er with no doors, stairs, or visible means 
of approach. On top of the tower are be-
lieved to be the bones of Rostam and his 
horse Rakhsh; their bodies were exposed 
to the sun and the vultures in the Zoroas-
trian manner, but their bones were never 
retrieved. Instead, the tower was sealed to 
serve as a monument.
Around the city are salt marshes; these 
are inundated when the level of the lake 
rises every year. Beyond the marshes are 
the desert sands. The Zaranj area is fa-
mous for its baad sad va bist rooz, the “120-
day wind” which blows north to south 
from the beginning of summer until the 
autumn. As it blows, it whips up a cloud of 
dust that clothes the whole region in dirt. 
Some believe the wind to be the home of 
jinn, but in fact it is a host of migrating 
air elementals (see Realms of Power: Magic, 
page 138) who cavort through the area 
once a year.
Khurasan
The largest province of Persia, 
Khurasan is named after khor, the sun, in-
dicating that for many Persians, the sun 
rises over Khurasan. The region has long 
operated as an independent sultanate, but 
is now firmly part of the Empire of the 
Khwarazm-shah. Seistan, Quhistan, and 
Ghur are all districts of Khurasan rather 
than provinces in their own right.
Herat
Known as the Pearl of Khurasan, Her-
at is dominated by the remains of a citadel 
built by Alexander the Great. Like many of 
the cities in this area, Herat has changed 
hands many times in the last century, but 
it has nevertheless managed to develop 
a reputation for brassworking, which re-
mains its chief export.
Herat boasts a Zoroastrian fire temple 
called Sirishk just two leagues to the north 
atop a hill; unusually, this temple is still in-
habited by a mobed and attracts worship-
ers from the nearby hills. The presence of 
Shamiran castle directly behind the tem-
ple may have contributed to its longevity. 
There is also a Nestorian church between 
Sirishk and Herat. To the south of the city 
is a lush land like a garden, profusely ir-
rigated by numerous canals.
Karakum Desert
This “black sand” desert, also called 
the Desert of the Ghuzz, lies between the 
Caspian Sea to the west and the Aral Sea 
to the north. It is bounded on its north-
eastern border by the Oxus River which 
flows into the Aral Sea in Khwarazm.
Merv
An important oasis-city on the Silk 
Road, Merv has been named “the ren-
dezvous of the great and the small” as a 
testament to its immense market, where, 
if accounts are true, it is possible to buy 
anything. Merv once claimed to be the 
largest city in the world, but in 1153 it 
was pillaged by the Ghuzz nomads, and 
since then has changed hands between the 
Khwarazmians, the Ghuzz, and the Ghu-
rids, and has lost importance in Khurasan 
in favor of Nishapur. The last of the great 
Seljuks, Sultan Sanjar, is buried in Merv, 
under a great dome covered in blue tiles 
which is so high that it can be seen from a 
day’s march away.
The libraries of Merv are greatly cel-
ebrated. The Great Mosque has two: the 
Lake Zarah and Mount Khajeh
According to Nestorian Christian-
ity, the three magi started their trip to 
Bethlehem from Lake Zarah. Accord-
ing to Mazdean legend, the lake is the 
keeper of Zoroaster’s seed; when the 
final renovation of the world is near 
three virgins will enter the lake and 
thence give birth to the saviors of man-
kind. The waters of the lake have a Di-
vine aura of 2.
A flat-topped black hill called Mount 
Khajeh emerges from the waters of Lake 
Zarah. It bears an ancient fire temple 
and two abandoned forts collectively 
called Qal’a-e Sam — the “fort of Saum” 
— named after Rostam’s grandfather.
Story Seed: The Riddles
The Emir of Herat has made a strange 
announcement: “One must come to me, 
neither clothed nor naked, neither afoot 
nor on horse, and speak to me neither 
indoors nor out. If this person does not 
come, then Herat shall be destroyed!” 
The emir is under the control of a hor-
rible ghoul, and the only way to free 
him is to answer its three riddles, and 
the emir reckons anyone clever enough 
to answer his own riddle is also smart 
enough to answer those of the ghoul. 
Unfortunately, the ghoul also has a 
powerful Death Prophecy: it can only 
be killed by someone who is neither 
man nor beast; by someone who does 
it neither by day or by night; someone 
who offers it a present that is not a gift; 
neither by metal, nor rope, nor poison, 
nor stone, nor fire, nor water; and by 
someone who is neither fasting nor eat-
ing at the time.

The Cradle & The Crescent
‘Aziziyah, with over 12,000 books; and 
the Kamaliyah library, with slightly few-
er. Also stored here are the libraries of the 
colleges of Samanidiyah, ‘Umaydiyah, 
and Khatuniya. The Dumayriyah library 
is perhaps one of the smallest, but many 
of its 200 books are unique, and all are 
priceless. Of most interest to the Suhhar 
Sulayman, the library of the grand vizier 
Nizam al-Mulk is part of the greater col-
lection of Merv, and its House of Wis-
dom is the keeper of these great tomes 
of magic. 
Merv is home to a group of faeries who 
dwell in the market, running stalls next to 
the locals. These faeries help fulfill Merv’s 
reputation as a place where anything can 
be purchased. They gain vitality from 
making exchanges with mortals, although 
they themselves do not supply any goods; 
they simply arrange a deal with a different 
mortal who can provide the desired goods. 
The result is an intricate web of favors and 
exchanges that might involve several tiers 
of mortal involvement.
If the characters need a particularly 
exotic ingredient or item, then Merv is a 
Rishtah
A disease that is particularly common 
in Khurasan thanks to the malign influ-
ence of Mars is rishtah, known as dracuncu-
lus (“little dragon”) in Latin. Worms form 
in the flesh of the limbs of the victim, and 
their hot venom causes severe inflamma-
tion and paralysis of the infected limb. 
Most often the legs are affected (caus-
ing the Lame Flaw until cured), but rish-
tah occasionally afflicts the arms or eyes 
(simulated with the Missing Hand or 
Missing Eye Flaws, respectively). Rishtah 
is difficult to contract, but also difficult to 
eliminate without medical assistance. It 
is a Serious Choleric disease of Severity 
12; with a Stable Ease Factor of 4 and a 
Recovery Ease Factor of 18. The interval 
time is one month (for more details of 
diseases, see Art & Academe, page 45).
A cure used by the Ghuzz is to bury 
the afflicted limb in hot sand from dawn 
until dusk. The worm then migrates from 
the limb and into the sand. The problem 
with this cure is that sometimes the rish-
tah survives in the sand and can grow to 
be five feet long (and some report even 
bigger ones). The Ghuzz call such a 
worm the olghoi khorkhoi, and report that 
it has been known to attack travelers and 
livestock with its fiery venom.

Found in the northern deserts of Per-
sia and Transoxiana, the olghoi khorkhoi 
(“intestine worm”) is the mature form of 
the worms that cause the disease called 
rishtah. It can move about freely beneath 
the soil, and, while blind, is very sensitive 
to vibrations. If it succeeds in a Dexter-
ity + Stealth roll greater than its victim’s 
Perception + Awareness roll, it can burst 
out of the ground next to him, gaining a 
+3 bonus to Attack on the first round of 
combat only. Initiative is rolled after this 
initial attack. Animals instinctively shy 
from the olghoi khorkhoi, and the reac-
tion of horses is often the first sign that 
one is in the area.

good place to find it, but the price might 
be equally difficult to obtain. The answer 
is to visit a different faerie merchant to 
obtain that thing, hoping he will ask in 
return for something easier to get. The 
trick is knowing when to stop; you might 
end up needing to find a pebble with 
a white spot on it, but you are equally 
likely to be asked for the crown of the 
Sasanid king!
Mashhad
The city of Mashhad is perhaps best 
known for its luxurious shrine to Imam 
Reza, the eighth Shi’i imam. Reza was un-
expectedly appointed by the Sunni Caliph 
Mamun to be his successor to the Abba-
sid caliphate. Following violent uprisings 
from the Sunni Muslims after hearing this 
announcement, Reza suddenly died before 
he could take his post, leading the Shi’a to 
accuse Mamun of regretting his decision 
and solving the tense political situation 
with murder.
Mashhad ar-Rizawi (“the place of the 
martyrdom of Reza”) was built on the site 
of his death, a tradition arose that a pil-
grimage to Mashhad was worth 70,000 
pilgrimages to Mecca, and the tomb of 
the imam became a holy place to which 
people flocked from all over Persia. The 
shrine has a Divine aura of 6.
Nishapur
On a strategic site controlling access 
to the east, Nishapur is named after the 
first Sassanian King, Shapur I, who made 
it his capitol for a brief time. Like most of 
Khurasan’s cities, Nishapur is dominated 
by its market. Its market streets have many 
hostels for the merchants, and almost ev-
ery trade is represented here. Virtually all 
Story Seed: Save the Books
The invasion of the Ghuzz have 
taught the sahirs of Merv a lesson. 
An even bigger threat, in the shape of 
Genghis Khan, looms to the east, and 
Merv is home to thousands of books 
that can never be replaced. Unable to 
impress on the colleges and madrasas 
the importance of moving their books 
to a safer location, the sahirs are doing 
their best to copy as many as they can. 
This frantic attempt to preserve these 
irreplaceable texts can lead to any num-
ber of stories:
• A forgotten secret is uncovered 
when a book is copied. Example: the 
location of Solomon’s Seal.
• Theft of books to which clerics 
deny access. Example: A daring raid 
into the Dumayriyah to liberate a tome of 
Isma’ili theology.
• Transport of books to a safe place. 
Example: Some of Nizam al-Mulk’s most 
prominent tomes are moved further west, 
but a group of hostile magicians are aware 
of the opportunity to steal magical power 
for themselves.
The Footsteps of Imam Reza
All along the road between Nishapur 
and Mashhad are imprints on the rocky 
road which are locally believed to be the 
footprints of Imam Reza left as he made 
his fateful journey towards his death in 
Mashhad. It is said that a person who 
retraces every footstep and matches his 
own to them will be especially blessed in 
the next venture he undertakes. Howev-
er, several of the footsteps are difficult to 
locate thanks to erosion and the actions 
of malicious jinn, who sometimes create 
false trails to lead petitioners astray. Com-
pleting the pilgrimage should involve a 
short story where the character’s faith is 
tested, but if completed successfully, the 
character gains the Intuition Virtue for 
the duration of his next venture.

the turquoise and malachite that makes 
its way into the Middle East and Europe 
originates from mines near Nishapur.
Mihr
This unprepossessing village on the 
road to Nishapur is the home to one of 
the three Royal Fires of Zoroastrianism 
(see Mount Kavarvand, earlier, for more 
information on the Royal Fires). The ru-
ins of a fire temple hide the entrance to 
a terrestrial Divine regio of aura 8. With-
in, the fire temple is intact, and inside it 
burns Adur Burzen-Mihr, the holy flame. 
This fire is specifically tied to farmers and 
craftsmen, just as the other two fires are 
tied to royalty and the priesthood. A tool 
left in the regio for a year will be purified 
by the holy flame, and henceforth grant a 
+4 bonus to any Craft or Profession Abil-
ity rolls made using it. This bonus lasts for 
a number of years equal to the Theology: 
Mazdean Ability of its owner. Only the 
owner of the tool can benefit from this bo-
nus; should another even touch the tool, it 
loses its purity forever.
Quhistan
This “land of the mountains” is on 
the east of the Great Desert, bounded by 
Khurasan and Seistan. It is mostly a high-
land district with a corresponding cool cli-
mate, unlike the surrounding lands. While 
technically a dependency of Khurasan, 
Quhistan is part of the shadow Isma’ili state 
(see later), and they control the mountain 
fortresses of Turshiz, Qa’in, Birjand, Mu-
minabad, Dara, Tabas and Nih.
Ghur
The people of Ghur are more closely 
related to the Baluchi and the people of 
Bactria and Badakhshan than they are to 
Persians. When the Shansabani (see in-
sert) were driven from Ghur by the Kh-
warazm-shah, they unfortunately left their 
familiar demons and evil spirits behind. As 
‘Umar Khayyam
This famous astronomer, poet, and 
sahir lived and taught in Nishapur until 
his death in 1123. He was trained in the 
Solomonic Arts at Nishapur’s House of 
Wisdom — a House he later went on to 
lead — and was an apprentice with both 
Hasan-i Sabbah and Nizam al-Mulk 
(see The Nizari Isma’ilis State, later). 
Nizam al-Mulk later provided him with 
a yearly pension to continue his studies. 
‘Umar Khayyam wrote several influen-
tial books on mathematics, astronomy, 
and philosophy, but he is best known 
for his poetry.

gebra; written in Arabic; Summa on 
Artes Liberales (Level 5, Quality 9)

The Cypress of Kishmar
In Kishmar near Turshiz, Zoro-
aster planted a cypress tree that had 
sprung from a branch he had brought 
from Paradise. It grew taller than any 
cypress ever had, a monument to the 
conversion of King Goshtasp to Zoro-
astrianism. It was uprooted in 861 by 
Caliph Mutawakkil and transported 
across Persia to be used for beams in 
his new palace, although the caliph 
was killed on the very day it reached 
its destination.
There are several cypresses in 
Quhistan that people claim have grown 
from seeds of the Kishmar tree, and in 
some cases, this is even true. The trees 
themselves radiate a Divine aura of 1 
within five paces, and this aura is auto-
matically tempered with the Calm vir-
tue (see Realms of Power: The Divine, pages 
38–39). Wood from the fallen branches 
of these trees fed into the sacred fire of a 
Zoroastrian temple increases the Divine 
aura of the temple by 1 point until the 
wood has been burnt. Wood chopped 
from the trees lack this property.
The Shansabani
The ruling family of Ghur have long 
been the Shansabani family, who claim 
Zahhak (see earlier) as their first ances-
tor. Sultan Ala’uddin Hussain, known as 
Jahansoz (“World Burner”), took Ghur 
from the Ghaznavids with the help of his 
demonic patrons, and he and his kin ruled 
over Ghur (and later Khurasan) with an 
iron fist. The Shansabani brooked no 
dissent or disaffection, and any political 
troublemakers simply disappeared mys-
teriously. The sultans of Ghur pursued an 
aggressive policy with their neighbors, 
but fortunately for Persia, their attentions 
were drawn to the fabled east rather than 
west or south. They were divided into 
three branches: one ruled Bactria and 
Badakhshan from Bamiyan, another ruled 
Khurasan from Ghazni, and the main 
branch ruled Ghur from Firuzkuh.
The last Shansabani sultan was Mo-
hammed al-Ghuri, and he was a host to 
Zahhak. The Shansabani never conced-
ed the province and have not been of-
ficially replaced, but they have all van-
ished. Some claim they have left Persia 
for Mythic Hind; others claim they have 
gone into hiding. One persistent rumor 
places the Shansabani heir at the court 
of Genghis Khan.

The Cradle & The Crescent
a consequence, Ghur is a dangerous land, 
and many of its roads are haunted by mali-
cious jinn. The towns are home to demons 
that walk in human form, and the Ghurs 
live in permanent suspicion of their neigh-
bors, and even members of their own fam-
ily should they start to act in an unusual 
manner. In some towns, the demons have 
taken over and rule openly, and the hu-
mans are powerless to stop them.
Bamiyan
A rich yet unfortified city in the east 
of the Ghur district, Bamiyan was recently 
one of the three capitals of the Shansaba-
ni. Its people are infidels and pay respect 
to two great idols high up on the moun-
tainside. In a chamber supported on col-
umns are two statues cut into the living 
rock; the locals call these Surkh and Khing 
(“Red” and “Gray,” respectively) and in the 
convoluted religion of Bamiyan they are 
twin aspects of a single god. The cham-
ber in which these idols are found is richly 
decorated with carvings of birds, which 
have been covered in beaten gold. The 
two idols wander occasionally from their 
mountainside nook, bringing a Faerie aura 
with them as they come. When Khing 
walks, the people of Bamiyan hold feasts 
in its honor and bedeck it with flowers, but 
when Surkh fares abroad they hide within 
their houses and tremble. 
Firuzkuh
The summer capital of the Ghurids, 
Firuzkuh means “turquoise mountain” in 
the local dialect due to the preponder-
ance of that mineral, along with silver, 
in the surrounding hills. Firuzkuh was a 
retreat used by the Shansabani to keep 
their wicked activities hidden. Many of 
their political enemies were brought in 
secret to Firuzkuh, and drowned in the 
Hari river. Some claim that Firuzkuh 
was the center of devil-worship by the 
Shansabani. The palace is now empty, al-
though the ghosts of the family’s victims 
still stalk its halls.
The Minaret
Located on a bend in the Hari River, 
the Minaret of Firuzkuh stands over 200 
feet high, and is made of baked bricks. It 
is intricately decorated with glazed tiles 
bearing alternating bands of Qur’anic 
verses, geometric patterns, and calligra-
phy in multiple scripts. The verses from 
the Qur’an are taken from the surat Maryam, 
which relate to Mary, the mother of Jesus. 
The minaret has been under assault from 
the jinn of the Hari, and just recently the 
mosque to which the minaret was attached 
was destroyed in a flash flood. The mina-
ret stands firm against their attacks, for it 
is powerfully warded against supernatural 
creatures. Sahirs have spend long years 
trying to figure out the means by which it 
is protected, but the minaret’s secrets have 
so far eluded them, other than to deter-
mine it is of Divine origin.
Ghazni
Formerly the capital of the mamluk of 
Ghur, but now abandoned by the Shan-
sabani, Ghazni is famous for the Bahram-
shah mosque, which has minarets with a 
star-shaped cross-section, covered in geo-
metric patterns. It is also well-known as a 
fabulously rich city, with ornate decora-
tions on the lowliest of buildings, and os-
tentatious displays of gold and jewels from 
its inhabitants. Even the lowliest peasant 
has a gold necklace or bracelet, and higher 
status individuals drip with precious gems. 
These riches derive from the Wealth of Na-
tions power of a False God (Realms of Power: 
The Infernal, page 37) worshiped in secret 
by the Ghaznians.
Kabul
A city greatly frequented by mer-
chants, who travel up the single fortified 
road to the market to trade with the ex-
otic merchants who also come here from 
Mythic Hind. Of most interest to the 
Persians is indigo, which can command a 
rich price further west. However, a more 
sinister substance is also sought out: a sub-
stance called myrobalan, a greasy speckled 
powder with a spicy nature akin to pepper 
or cardamom. Myrobalan is of great inter-
est to physicians, since when properly pre-
pared it can have potent curative proper-
ties. However, it can induce hallucinations 
that can be pleasurable (if the myrobalan 
is prepared with wine) or horrific (if pre-
pared with water). Either sensation proves 
devastatingly addictive, and the markets 
of Kabul are littered by myrobalan addicts 
with their distinctive vacant expressions 
and dark-stained teeth. Kabul is ruled by 
a demon known only as “The Shadowed 
One,” who is somehow connected to the 
trade in myrobalan. None have seen him 
in person; his four lieutenants control the 
people on his behalf with their demon-
granted powers.
The Nizari 
Isma’ili State
The Isma’ili state is unlike others in the 
Mythic Middle East, in that it does not ex-
ist on maps, or in terms of military might, 
but rather lies in the hearts of men. It is a 
small state and widely scattered, neverthe-
less it is united under a strong devotion to 
its beliefs and goals, and has successfully 
resisted all threats aimed against it since 
its foundation over a hundred years ago. 
The Nizaris exercise political dominance 
in Persia, not through their meager terri-
torial successes but through the point of a 
knife and through magical murder. Rather 
than meeting their enemies in battle they 
use subterfuge and deception to eliminate 
the leaders.
History
In the middle of the 11th century, 
three apprentice sahirs at the same House 
of Wisdom in Nishapur — Abu ‘Ali al-Tusi, 
Hasan-i Sabbah, and ‘Umar Khayyam — 
became the closest of friends. They swore 
a pact of brotherhood that if any one of 
them achieved fame and greatness, he

The Cradle & The Crescent
would share it with his friends. Abu ‘Ali al-
Tusi was the rising star of the trio, and be-
came vizier to the Seljuk Sultanate (where 
he gained the laqab of Nizam al-Mulk), 
and also grand vizier of the Suhhar Sulay-
man. As agreed, he offered positions to his 
friends; ‘Umar refused, asking instead for 
the means to continue his studies. Hasan 
accepted, but only to get close to the vi-
zier. He had secretly become a member of 
the Isma’ili sect of Islam, and at their in-
stigation, murdered his childhood friend. 
The Suhhar Sulayman was outraged, but 
true to the dying wishes of their grand vi-
zier they held fire on their vengeance. Rec-
onciliation between Hasan and the Suhhar 
Sulayman soon became impossible, and a 
schism within the Isma’ilis caused Prince 
Nizar — Hasan’s superior — to flee to the 
mountain fortress of Alamut in Persia. 
Hasan-i Sabbah continued to train 
his devoted followers in the arts of Solo-
monic magic, and, it is rumored, to com-
mand sentient spirits. The Nizari Isma’ilis 
became feared for their single-minded 
devotion, using magic to walk in secret, 
ensorcel minds, kill through poison, and 
travel vast distances in the blink of an eye. 
These tactics proved to be shockingly ef-
fective, and the Seljuk governor of Persia 
— despite help from the Suhhar Sulay-
man — proved incapable of mounting 
an effective response. The Nizaris were 
successful in taking key towns, but their 
strategy merely caused the populace to 
fear Isma’ilism, rather than embrace it. The 
Nizaris and the Suhhar Sulayman settled 
into a pattern of attempting to wipe each 
other out, but losses on both sides have 
been roughly equal. The Isma’ili sect have 
also established a branch in Syria, also 
based in mountain castles. The most fa-
mous member of this branch was Rashid 
al-Din Sinan (who died in 1193), who be-
came well-known to the crusaders as “the 
Old Man of the Mountains.”
A Sect of Assassins
The sect is divided into seven ranks. 
The lowest ranks are those of the fida’i (de-
voted one) and lasiq (adherent), neither of 
which are properly initiated into the cult. 
These ranks perform the assassinations 
that give the sect its notoriety and politi-
cal pressure. The first initiated rank is the 
mustajib (respondent), who know some of 
the mysteries of the cult, but have none of 
the authority of the next three grades, da’i 
(“missionary”), hujja (“proof”) and dai’d-duat 
(“chief missionary”). The seventh and final 
rank is that of the imam-qa’im, the mystical 
teacher and spiritual leader of the sect.
The Nizaris are organized into jaziras 
(“islands”), each representing a geographi-
cal territory, and under the control of a hu-
jja. The da’is within each jazira are respon-
sible for preaching the doctrines of the sect 
and spreading the Isma’ili faith. Each hujja 
reports directly to the dai’d-duat, who is 
the head of the sect and grand master of 
Alamut. Members of the sect commonly 
refer to each other as rafiq, “comrade.”
The Da’wa
The da’wa (mission) is the philosophy 
and organization of the Nizaris. A core 
doctrine is that of taqiyya, the concealment 
of one’s beliefs in the face of danger. Islam 
stresses the importance of truth and hon-
esty, and yet taqiyya allows the Isma’ilis 
to deny their adherence to its precepts 
and live in secret among others. It per-
mits them to use subterfuges and disguises 
without betraying their faith in God. 
Nizaris believe in the inner meaning, 
or batin, of the Qur’an, holding that it con-
tains the very secrets of the universe if the 
layers of symbolism and numerical corre-
spondence can be understood. They live 
an ascetic life according to the 51 epistles 
of Isma’ilism, called the Rasa’il. They be-
lieve that shari’a law no longer applies to 
those who embrace the batin, and conse-
quently, they reject the five Pillars of Islam 
(and hence receive no benefit from them; 
see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 106), 
dietary restrictions, the authority of the 
caliph, and so forth. 
According to the da’wa, ever since 
the creation of the world, human history 
has been characterized by alternating cy-
cles, each begun by a “speaking” imam or 
prophet (the imam-qa’im), followed by a 
succession of “silent” imams. They hold 
that the imam represents God’s will in the 
world at all times, that he is constantly un-
der divine guidance since the batin flows 
through him, and that his commands de-
mand absolute obedience. Nizar was a 
member of the true line of silent imams, 
followed by Hasan-i Sabbah and the other 
dai’d-duats of Alamut.
The imam-qai’m is an immortal be-
ing of unlimited wisdom, who has been, 
in the past, Elijah, Enoch, Khidr, and ‘Ali 
(the first Shi’i imam). It is believed that the 
current cycle is the qiyama (“resurrection”), 
and that the souls of those who follow the 
da’wa are already in heaven, whereas the 
souls of all other Muslims — plus those of 
a non-Muslim faith — have already been 
judged and suffer in hell.
The Nizaris Today
The current dai’d-duat of the Nizari 
Isma’ilis is Jalal al-Din Hasan, who suc-
ceeded in 1210. During his rule, Jalal al-Din 
has done the unthinkable — publicly con-
An Assassin by Another Name
In Syria, the Nizari Isma’ilis have 
been slandered with the name of “hash-
ishiyyin” (smokers of hashish); this sobri-
quet was adopted by the Crusaders as 
“assassin,” and is the origin of the mod-
ern term. The rigidly ascetic Nizaris do 
not use drugs of any kind, and in any 
case they would likely interfere with the 
concentration and planning required 
for executing their public murders. The 
name stems instead from the contempt 
felt for the wild beliefs and extravagant 
behavior displayed by the Isma’ilis, and 
in any case is not used to describe the 
main Persian sect.
In Persia, the Isma’ilis are princi-
pally known as the Batiniyya (men of 
the batin), suggesting that they place 
too much emphasis on the inner mean-
ing of the Qur’an; or the Malahida (her-
etics), referring to their rejection of 
shari’a law.

The Cradle & The Crescent
New Nizari Virtues
New Virtue: Fida’i
Social Status, Minor
The character is an assassin of the 
Nizari Isma’ilis. A fida’i is a devout mem-
ber of the sect who is prepared to die on 
its orders, and as such he should consider 
taking either the Oath of Fealty or Du-
tybound Flaw. When not on a mission, a 
fida’i wears white, with a red girdle, cap, 
or boots. He has been trained in precise 
placement of daggers and blades, as well 
as disguise. Fida’i may take Martial Abili-
ties at character creation. He can expect 
to become a lasiq if he proves his loyalty 
to the sect.
New Virtue: Lasiq
Social Status, Major
The character is an experienced as-
sassin of the Nizari Isma’ilis, having suc-
cessfully completed seven murders at 
the orders of his grand master, and com-
mands a small band of up to six fida’is. 
Lasiq may take Martial Abilities at char-
acter creation.
New Virtue: Mustajib
Social Status, Free
This Virtue is the Nizari equivalent 
of the Sahir Virtue. The character has 
been initiated into the magical tradi-
tions of the Nizaris, and must take Sol-
omonic Sihr as his Summoning Power. 
If a mustajib has The Gift, he has been 
Opened to all of the Solomonic Arts; if 
he is unGifted, then the Solomonic Arts 
must be bought as Virtues or else be 
Initiated after character creation. Un-
Gifted characters should also take the 
Necessary Condition and Prohibition 
Flaws to represent Initiation by the Niz-
aris. Mustajib may take Academic and 
Arcane Abilities at character creation. 
Most mustajibs started their careers as 
fida’is, and typically have this Virtue 
(or the Lasiq Virtue) to represent their 
social status among non-magical folk. 
However, if he joined the sect later in 
life he may choose different Social Sta-
tus Virtue. 
New Virtue: Trained Assassin
General, Minor
This Virtue is only available to 
characters with one of the three Social 
Status Virtues of the Nizaris. He has 
completed several missions on behalf 
of his masters, giving him 50 additional 
experience points that may be spent on 
any Martial Abilities as well as Athletics, 
Guile, or Stealth.
Initiation Scripts of the Nizaris
Two example Initiation Scripts are 
given here. Nizaris are almost always 
Initiated into Solomonic Storytelling in 
preference to other Solomonic Arts.
Initiation of Solomonic Sihr 
and the Rank of Mustajib
Ease Factor: 21
Script Bonus: +18
Details: This rite takes place at Al-
amut during Ramadan (+3). The Initi-
ate is taken to the garden and magically 
transported to the Magic Realm by his 
mystagogue (using Solomonic Travel). 
He finds himself in an insula (see Realms 
of Power: Magic, page 19) of intense para-
dise, populated with beautiful maidens to 
cater to his every need. He must quest to 
find himself a companion spirit through 
which he will work his magic (+3), and 
in the process of this quest his magic is 
bound very closely to a weapon that rep-
resents that spirit, imposing the Neces-
sary Condition (brandishing a weapon) 
onto all of the character’s magic (+9). 
When he returns to the mundane 
world with the vision of paradise still fill-
ing his head, he is told that the master of 
Alamut can return him to paradise at any 
time, and he is promised a place in para-
dise permanently if he dies in his service. 
In return he swears a magically-enforced 
oath to never betray the secrets of the 
sect, lest he be damned to eternal fire 
(the Prohibition Flaw, +3).
The ritual that Opens the Arts of a 
Gifted Nizari has similar elements to this 
Initiation, although it does not impose 
any Flaws.
Initiation of Solomonic 
Storytelling
Ease Factor: 21
Script Bonus: +15
Details: The initiate is asked to sur-
render all contact with the outside world 
and devote himself to the sect. He must 
donate all his possessions and land to the 
Nizaris, and cut off all ties with family 
and friends. Even his name is changed to 
a cultic name (+2). 
The initiatory rite takes place at Al-
amut when Sirius rises (+3); the initiate 
is taken once more to the paradise in-
sula within the Magic Realm. He must 
quest on at least three different insulae 
(thus navigating the Void that sepa-
rates them), and obtain three objects 
that resonate with three different emo-
tions (+6). 
Upon returning to the mundane 
world, he must spend a season compos-
ing an encoded poem which tells of his 
journey while appearing to be about an 
entirely different subject, demonstrating 
his mastery of the batin (+1). 
After this second visit to paradise, 
the mustajib discovers that any use of 
his magic briefly transports him mentally 
back there (simulated by the Disorien-
tating Magic Flaw, +3).

The Cradle & The Crescent
verted the sect to Sunni Islam. The Nizaris 
recognize this as an exercise in taqiyya and 
have obeyed without question. Jalal al-Din 
expects to garner support from the enemies 
of the Khwarazm-shah, namely the Caliph 
of Baghdad in the west and Genghis Khan 
in the east. He has already made alliances 
with the rulers of Arran and Azerbaijan, 
and married the four daughters of the emir 
of Gilan. Since he has ushered in a new era 
of outward law, many of Isma’ilis believe 
Jalal al-Din to be the imam-qa’im.
Relations with the Suhhar Sulayman are 
hostile; the Suhhar still holds the Nizaris 
as traitors and refuses to treat with them. 
Many sahirs attempt to slay or drive off 
known Nizaris, most often using the fear 
and hatred of the populace against them. 
The Nizaris, on the other hand, have no 
specific enmity towards the Suhhar Sulay-
man, but treat them like any other power-
ful individual — if they stand in the way of 
the imam’s coming, then they die.
In addition to Daylam, Quhistan, and 
Qumis (mentioned earlier), the Nizaris 
have significant hidden communities in 
the south of the Zagros Mountains in Fars 
(including the fortress of Shardiz), and 
scattered cells in most of the important 
cities in the Mythic Middle East. The Syr-
ian Assassins have their base at Masyaf in 
the Holy Land, with a further stronghold 
near Aleppo.
Alamut
Alamut was built by one of the kings of 
Daylam; he was out hunting one day and 
his eagle alighted on a rock. He imme-
diately saw the strategic potential of the 
site, and built a castle there that he called 
aluh-amut, which in the Daylami language 
means “the eagle’s lesson.” Since then, Al-
amut has become more than just a castle; 
it is a fortified village in Rudbar, the valley 
of the Shahrud.
Alamut is physically an immense, tow-
ering rock, with unapproachable slopes on 
all sides, and yet a flat top on which ex-
tensive buildings have been constructed. It 
has vast storerooms hollowed out from the 
very bedrock, and possesses its own spring. 
A notable feature amid the dust and rock is 
a luxurious garden; this is the source of the 
fortress’s Magic aura of 3, and it contains a 
link to the Magic Realm important in the 
initiatory rituals of the Nizaris (see later).
Nizari Characters
The rank of fida’i is suitable for grog 
and companion characters, who should 
take the Dutybound Flaw (or, for com-
panion characters, the Oath of Fealty 
Flaw) to represent the vows of obedience 
taken to the grand master of the sect. If 
a fida’i proves himself to be capable, he 
can expect to be elevated to the rank 
of lasiq, and command a squad of men. 
Only a fraction of the Nizaris become 
Initiated into the magical traditions of 
the sect, and become mustajibs. The rank 
of da’i (which is not represented by a So-
cial Status Virtue) is awarded to mustajibs 
who have Initiated at least two Solomon-
ic Arts other than Solomonic Sihr; all 
Gifted mustajibs are automatically da’is. 
A da’i is expected to lead a community 
of Isma’ilis and to convert others to the 
cause. The ranks of hujja and dai’d-duat 
are both available to player characters 
through roleplaying. 
Apart from those things noted in the 
inserts nearby, mustajibs (and da’is) should 
be created using the rules for sahirs (see 
Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman).

The fabled route to distant Serica, the 
land of silk, is beginning to coalesce again 
at the beginning of the 13th century, as 
the Mongol invasion paradoxically cre-
ates a degree of safety for traveling mer-
chants and missionaries by controlling the 
almost incessant brigandage of the area. 
Later to become known as the Silk Road, 
the route has existed throughout antiquity 
in various states of accessibility. It consists 
of not one road but many — a network of 
caravan stages, marked by resting places 
known as caravanserais, that branches 
and reforms through the deserts, steppes 
and mountains as the caravans travel 
northeastward from Baghdad. Through 
Khurasan and into the Eastern Provinces 
of Transoxiana, Badakhshan, and Wakhan, 
the trade routes delve past the borders of 
Mythic Middle East and even into the su-
pernatural Realms beyond. 
Transoxiana
Beyond the great river known to the 
ancients as the Oxus lay the borderlands 
of Mawara’n-nahr, “the Lands Beyond the 
River.” Known first as Turan to the Persians, 
then later as Transoxiana to the Greeks 
and Romans, these lands have always been 
at the edge of civilization. Nominally 
ruled by the Khwarazmshah, the region 
includes the ancient oases of Farghana, 
Sogdia and Bactria, the estuarine province 
of Khwarazm, and the jinn-infested des-
ert of Kyzylkum (“red desert”) — all bor-
dered by the endless northeastern steppes 
and the harsh eastern mountain arc of the 
Pamir and Paromisidae.
Invaded by the triumphant Arabs un-
der Qutayba in the seventh century, Tran-
soxiana was washed over by the Islamic 
empire until its wave of conquest broke on 
the shores of the vast inland steppe. Islam 
itself changed and adapted as it flowed 
into the steppe — orthodox Sunni practic-
es found little hold, but the ecstatic brand 
of Sufi mysticism, with similarities to the 
shamanism of the Turkish nomads and a 
focus on highly charismatic holy men, was 
more successful. Many of the inhabitants 
profess Islam but cling to many pagan be-
liefs and folk traditions linked to the local 
Faerie and Magic spirits.
The region has a history of loose pas-
toralist domination and local dynasties 
centered on riverine oases. No single au-
thority has ruled the borderlands between 
the pastoralist nomads and the urban set-
tlers since the ancient Turk Empire, al-
though this is about to change as a new 
nomad empire descends from the east.
The Great Rivers 
Transoxiana is bordered and defined 
by the two great rivers that flow through 
it — a liminal zone of cultural transi-
tion and trade, bordering the deserts

The Cradle & The Crescent
south of the Aral Sea and forming a bar-
rier between wild nomad steppes to the 
north beyond the Jaxartes and the urban 
settlements of the south across the Oxus. 
A third lesser river, the Zeravshan (“the 
golden”), courses past the great cities of 
Samarkand and Bukhara only to choke 
into dust in the deserts before reaching 
one of the inland seas.
The Oxus
Mistakenly associated with the He-
brew Gihon, one of the four rivers that 
flows into Eden, the great waterway known 
as the Jahyun to the Arabs, the Amu Darya 
to the Turks, and the Oxus to the classical 
Greeks has always been considered one 
of the frontiers of the classical world. Lo-
cals of the high Pamir village of Qarabo-
laq claim it is birthed from the eerie Lake 
Zorkul nearby, but the classic geographers 
claim it begins its journey as it melts from 
a great ice cave beneath a glacier high up 
in the fabled Wakhan corridor.
The original bed of the Oxus runs 
westward across the desert for six days 
march before reaching the shores of the 
distant Bahr Khazar (Caspian Sea) near 
the fishing town of Khalkhal. This former 
stretch of the river is devoid of magical 
spirits as they have all been bound into 
the structures and canals near Gurganj, but 
nevertheless retains a fading Magic aura of 
2 along its dusty length. On cool nights, 
when the constellation of Aquarius is as-
cending, small clear pools of water can be 
found along the dry bed and can be har-
vested for Aquam vis.
The Jaxartes
Also known as the Sayhun or the 
Nahr-ash-Shash (“the river of Shash”), the 
Jaxartes forms from numerous mountain 
streams in the valley of Farghana, flow-
ing through this province past the home-
land deserts of the Ghuzz Turks via many 
channels into the northeastern part of the 
Buhayrah Khwarazm (Aral Sea). More so 
than its greater sibling to the south, the 
Jaxartes forms the true border between 
Iran and Turan, Persian and Turk, civilized 
agrarian and barbaric nomad.
The Sea of Khazar
The Bahr Khazar (Khazar or Caspian 
Sea) forms the northwestern boundary 
of Transoxiana. Beyond its expanse to 
the northwest once ruled the mythical 
Khazars, a powerful kingdom of nomads 
that converted to Judaism in the ninth 
and tenth centuries. This lost kingdom 
held back the Islamic expansion in the 
ninth century, only to fade back into the 
steppes from where it arose. Stories about 
their far realm continue filter all the way 
back into Mythic Europe, even to the 
court of the popes. 
Although the Khazars have long since 
dispersed, the stories they engendered 
have spawned Faerie jinn that imitate their 
culture and kingdom. Those seeking the 
far northwestern shores of the sea past the 
Caucasus range, either by land or by water 
may encounter the secret isle of the Ama-
zons (see Rival Magic for details). Brave 
travelers that push further find themselves 
in the magical lands of the jinn and be-
yond, having delved into those outer parts 
of Jinnistan that lie in either the Faerie or 
Magic Realms.
Story Seeds for The Great Rivers
A River Runs Through It
In winter, both the lower Oxus 
and the Jaxartes freeze over, allowing 
merchant caravans (and lately nomad 
armies) to cross with ease. The cause of 
this phenomenon is an ongoing struggle 
between the Faerie and Magic jinn that 
claim dominance of the lands on either 
side of the great rivers. In winter, the 
local Faerie spirits hold sway and the 
rivers freeze over, allowing nomads and 
their stories to cross between the steppe 
and settled lands, engendering conflict 
and vitality for the faeries to feed off. 
In summer, the ancient Magic spirits 
resume their dominance, allowing the 
waters to flow in their natural course 
and providing irrigation to the towns of 
their lower reaches. 
Spirits of the Oxus Delta
Once a single mighty Magic Spirit, 
the clash of cultures along its lower 
banks has split the great spirit into a 
multitude of lesser entities as the river 
splits into numerous waterways and ca-
nals as it approaches the Aral Sea. Just 
short of this lake, the river is prevented 
from following its natural course by the 
great dykes of Gurganj, solid structures 
magically reinforced with captive jinn 
enslaved by the ancient sahirs of pre-Is-
lamic times. The sequence of dams that 
disrupt the natural course of the river 
allow irrigation of the rich province via 
many canals. 
Faerie, Infernal, and Magic (perhaps 
even Divine) lesser river spirits can be 
found along the river’s fragmented lower 
course, bound to its network of canals. 
Each spirit has its own unique name and 
cultural allegiance, although shifting 
alliances and swirling courts appear to 
collect from time to time.
One such lesser captive Magic 
spirit, Ahurani or Anahit, represents 
the vestige of a pre-Zoroastrian fertility 
spirit, or yazata, adopted by the Sogdi-
ans, now yoked to supply the harvests of 
the Khwarazmshah. The greater Faerie 
nobles known locally as Old Jahyun and 
the Son of the Oxus are known to be 
the most capricious and most powerful, 
although a clever magus or sahir may be 
able to bargain with one at the expense 
of the other.
The Jaxartes River Spirit
Unlike the Oxus, the Jaxartes is 
dominated by a single Faerie entity that 
involves itself in stories of nomad incur-
sions. The ancient Jaxartes spirit feeds 
on the fear of the urban oasis dwellers of 
the rapacious barbarians of the steppes, 
orchestrating an invasion every few cen-
turies by summoning a Faerie host with a 
new name through the gateway to Arca-
dia that lies just outside of Talas. See “The 
Endless Nomad Cycle” Story Seed later.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Aral Sea
Also known as the Lake of Khwarazm, 
this shallow and reedy lake is known for 
its excellent fishing in the southern part, 
although it is not considered navigable.
In the southeastern corner of the sea 
lies a small island, called Jabal Jaghra-
haz, that has a Magic Aura of 4. The 
water surrounding the island is perpetu-
ally frozen — local folk swear it must 
be the dwelling of powerful water jinn, 
the marid Jaghrahaz, but none are brave 
enough to venture across the frozen wa-
ter to investigate the small hill that the 
island contains.
Kyzylkum Desert

     as reported by Juvaini in  
     History of the World Conqueror
At the beginning of a canonical Ars 
Magica saga set at the start of 1220, 
Genghis Khan and a large detachment 
of his horde are encamped outside the 
besieged town of Bukhara. If history fol-
lows its course, the town will have fallen 
within two weeks, the surviving defend-
ers put to death without exception. All 
the civilians are ordered from the town; 
artisans are sent as slaves to Mongolia, 
young men forced to follow the army, 
and the women suffered far worse fates. 
A great fire breaks out and almost entire-
ly destroys the mostly wooden buildings 
and by the end of winter, there is little 
but smoking ruins left standing. Due to 
the atrocities committed in Bukhara, the 
whole area becomes overlaid by a Ma-
levolent Infernal aura of strength 3 (see 
Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 15) apart 
from the small area surrounding the 
Kalyan minaret. Many of the slain are 
not given proper burial, allowing their 
anguished ghosts to roam free through-
out the ruins or vulnerable to summon-
ing by necromantic magic.
Throughout 1220, the Mongol 
armies, reinforced by Turkish recruits 
and deserters, ravage along the Jaxartes 
all the way to Khojend in Farghana, 
destroying the oasis towns of Signak, 
Jand, Yanikent and Banakat. By the end 
of autumn 1220, when the horde settles 
down along the Vaksh River, the Khan’s 
armies have captured the twin capitals 
of the shah’s realm, Samarkand and 
Gurganj, and chased the Sultan him-
self across Khurasan to his death on the 
shore of the Caspian Sea. Within an-
other year, the Mongol juggernaut has 
penetrated into Persia, sacked Balkh, 
Merv, Nishapur, and Herat, and routed 
the Sultan’s son Jalal al-Din across the 
Indus, while the two great generals, 
Jebe and Subadei, have commenced 
their great raid into Russia. Abandoned 
and never resettled, the original sites of 
the sacked cities may become home to 
similar Infernal auras, tarnished with the 
Personality Trait of Wrath. Such places 
attract lesser demons of destruction, 
dark faeries, ghul, and malevolent jinn 
to the Mongol wake and add to the hu-
man misery.
Saga Seeds:  
Of Mongols and Magi ...
Exactly how these events affect your 
Saga depends on the role the main char-
acters intend to play within the region. 
For natives of Transoxiana, the Mongol 
invasion is devastating, resulting in a 
large loss of life and culture, but it can be 
used as a stimulus for introducing exist-
ing Hermetic characters to the Mythic 
Middle East. The massive tumult in the 
area may provide rich backgrounds for 
the introduction of wandering Mythic 
Middle Eastern companion characters 
into Western-based Sagas, similar to 
the diaspora following the fall of Con-
stantinople to the Latins in 1204. Con-
ventional Hermetic characters or their 
companions traveling in the area may 
become caught up in one of the sieges 
or escape from the sacking of a town and 
be forced to cooperate with native char-
acters in order to escape back to Chris-
tendom, bearing news of the “hurricane 
from the east” to the disbelieving Order. 
Trianoma magi seeking to assess the Or-
der of Suleiman may become embroiled 
in the fight against the Mongol jugger-
naut. Tytalan magi may be attracted to 
the conflict engendered, whereas House 
Tremere’s reconnaissance may lead them 
to become involved in assessing the de-
gree of threat posed by the invaders. 
Both Jerbiton magi and Redcaps may 
have links through trade or travel and be 
drawn into stories involving their mun-
dane connections or family. Necroman-
cers within the Order may be attracted 
to the sites of the massacres at Otrar, 
Bukhara, and other Transoxanian cities 
and be willing to risk their souls amidst 
the Infernal ruins.
A saga set primarily in the Mythic 
Middle East could be focused on rebuild-
ing amidst the ruins of Khwarazmshah’s 
state under the foreign yoke of the Mon-
gol Empire. The breakdown of mundane 
power structures and the scattering of 
local wizards could tempt Seekers and 
young Hermetic magi to mount expe-
ditions to explore and perhaps settle in 
covenants within the fractured polities 
of the former lands of Alexander’s great 
empire. Stories may run with the usual 
Spring covenant founding aim but could 
involve the complexities of dealing with 
both the foreign mundane civilians and 
unusual magical natives of the area while 
interacting with the Mongol aristocracy 
and the accompanying bureaucracy.

eastern edge: gazelles, golden eagles, deer 
and koulan (onagers or wild asses). 
The northern reaches are the domain 
of giant lizards known as waral or the vara-
nus —remarkably intelligent, their lead-
ers are able to walk on their hind legs and 
converse in the local language but appear 
to have only rudimentary magic.
Bactria
Once known as Bactriana and more 
recently referred to as Tokharistan, the 
lands cradled by the Oxus and the Cau-
casus Indicus have long been a melting 
pot of culture and a cauldron of rebellion. 
Although annexed as a satrapy by Cyrus 
the Great, the region resisted the attempts 
of Alexander to incorporate it into his em-
pire, only to form the center of first the 
Seleucid Empire and then an independent 
Greco-Bactrian kingdom.
Despite being conquered by succes-
sive waves of nomads — the Sakas, the 
Kushans, the Sassanids, the Hepthaelites, 
and most recently the Arab forces — the 
hinterland of the region retains many of its 
classical monuments and links to the Fa-
erie powers of Greek myth. Outside of the 
Theban Tribunal, it contains more classi-
cal Greek structures than anywhere else in 
the Mythic Middle East. 
Balkh
For a long time, the large and ancient 
city of Balkh was the home of Zoroastrian-
ism, since Zoroaster was born here and is 
buried within its walls. At the time of the 
Islamic invasion of Persia, Balkh provided 
a refuge to the Persian emperor Yezdgird, 
but in the current era it has thoroughly 
embraced Islam. The Greek name for 
Balkh was Bactra, and gave its name to the 
whole region of Bactria.
The Ruins at Ai Khanoum
Once an important center for Helle-
nism in the centuries before Christ, these 
eastern ruins lie at the confluence of the 
Jahyun and its tributary, the Nahr Dir-
gham. Originally founded by Alexander 
the Great as Alexandria on the Oxus, it 
was later developed into the important Se-
leucid city of Eucratidia. 
Partial remains of several structures, 
including a gymnasium, a theater almost 
the size of the great structure at Epidauros, 
and several temples to pagan Greek gods, 
most notably Zeus and Dionysius, give the 
area an overall Magic aura of 4. The gym-
nasium is the best preserved building and 
lies within a level 7 Magic aura, centered 
upon a pillar engraved with a dedication 
to both Hermes and Hercules.
Sogdian Rock
This landmark marks the site of an 
ancient battle between the forces of Alex-
ander and the rebellious satrap of Sogdia, 
Oxyartes of Balkh, father of the legendary 
beauty Roxane. It can only be accessed by 
little-known mountain paths and its exact 
location is known to only a handful of lo-
cal tribesmen. The ancient spirits of the 30 
men who fell during the ascent continue 
to haunt the site but bear no love for the 
successors of their Persian adversaries. 
Sogdiana
Since ancient times a land of mer-
chants and middlemen, Sogdiana remains 
a place of crossroads and caravans. The 
major trails from Baghdad cut through 
the province, passing through Samarkand 
and on to the Turkish lands beyond. Once 
Bactria Story Seeds
Naw Bahar
A fire temple by the name of Naw 
Bahar in one of Balkh’s suburbs was built 
in the Sassanian days as a rival to the 
Ka’ba of Mecca. Its walls are adorned 
with precious stones, and brocaded cur-
tains are hung everywhere. The walls 
and floor emit a sweet smell of perfume 
from centuries of application of un-
guents. The main building is surmount-
ed by a great cupola 375 feet high, and 
around this central building there are 
360 chambers to host the mobeds. 
Although no longer active as a temple 
it retains a Divine aura of 5. Naw Bahar 
remains unmolested by time or treasure 
seekers, and its floors are clean of detri-
tus and vermin. Those intrepid enough to 
go inside — and few are — report that 
a fire burns at the center of the temple, 
although no one is ever seen within. The 
inside of the temple leads to a Terrestrial 
Divine regio that shelters a small Zoroas-
trian community within the higher levels.
Altars of Alexander 
Of further interest to Hermetic 
Seekers, an altar of Alexander is hid-
den within one of the temples at the 
outskirts of the city. As detailed in 
Ancient Magic, page 125, the altars of 
Alexander have powerful mystical con-
nections to each other, and link to over 
70 different sites. A magus, casting a 
spell using the Arcane Connection 
Range while touching such an altar, is 
considered to have an Arcane Connec-
tion with a +4 Penetration multiplier 
to the other shrines, cities, or temples 
so connected. This site may either 
provide an entry point into the Mythic 
Middle East for Seekers investigating 
other sites or a potential lifeline back 
to Europe for Hermetic colonists deep 
within enemy territory.
A Covenant on the Rock?
Sogdian Rock is a superb natural 
fortress, riddled with natural caves and 
carved cisterns capable of holding large 
reserves of food and water in case of 
siege. The site is enveloped by a Magic 
aura of strength 3, although higher auras 
may exist within the deeper caves. Al-
though isolated, it is a potential base for 
Hermetic magi wishing to explore the 
mysteries of the Mythic Middle East.

communities, counting Sunni Muslims, 
Nestorian Christians, and Jews among its 
transient population.
Samarkand
“Everything I have heard about Mara-
kanda is true, except that it is more beauti-
ful than I ever imagined.” 
	
        — Alexander the Great
Known as Marakanda to the Greeks, 
the ancient capital of Sogdia on the up-
per Zeravshan River has been conquered 
by various conquerors throughout histo-
ry but remains one of the most populous 
and cosmopolitan cities of the region. It 
is the eastern capital of the Khwarazm-
shah’s empire.
To the east of the old city of Mara-
kanda lies Shahr-i-Zindah (“tomb of the 
living king”), a street of tombs named af-
ter the central shrine, the grave of Qusam 
ibn-Abbas. The remainder of the tombs 
are entrances to a city of dark Faerie jinn 
and ghul, giving the street a malevolent 
Faerie aura of 5 during the day alternating 
with an equivalent Infernal aura during the 
night. The shrine forms a forlorn sanctu-
ary amid the darkness, retaining a small 
Divine aura of strength 2. 
If your Saga follows history, in spring 
of 1220 the armies of Genghis Khan be-
siege the town. Despite recent fortifica-
tion, the city falls to the nomad hordes 
after only five days. The surrendering gar-
rison is executed in batches with ruthless 
efficiency. The population are moved out 
of the city to facilitate the sacking and di-
vided up like the unfortunates of Bukhara 
(see the insert “Genghis Khan and the Fall 
of Transoxiana” earlier).
Bukhara
A trading center since ancient times, 
Bukhara lies on the Zeravshan River 
downstream of Samarkand in the middle 
of the Kyzylkum Desert. In the ninth 
and tenth centuries it was the center of

The two-humped Bactrian camel pre-
dominates throughout the wider Mythic 
Middle East and differs slightly from its 
cousin, the single humped dromedary, 
which is more common in North Africa, 
Egypt, Arabia and the Levant (see Chap-
ter 6: Mythic Arabia for details on drom-
edaries). Wild camels are rare, although 
wild Bactrian camels can be found in the 
far eastern reaches.

can smell drinkable water for a dis-
tance up to two miles.
Survive Without Water, 0 points, Init 0: All 
camels can survive without water for 
up to two weeks.
Appearance: These statistics are for a 
typical Bactrian riding camel. Known 
for their stubbornness, resilience and 
pungent odor, these otherwise docile 
animals can become very aggressive 
during mating season. Their ability 
to last without water for weeks on 
end and locate buried water makes 
them the preferred beast of burden 
for desert crossings. 
Camels have been bred, like horses, 
to have differing traits:
Bactrian Pack Camel: Add the Do-
mesticated Quality and gain the Great 
Bearer Minor Heroic Virtue (Houses of 
Hermes: True Lineages, page 105), which 
allows the camel to carry twice as much 
on its back before becoming weighed 
down and to travel twice as far before 
becoming fatigued by a journey. Drop 
the Survival Ability. Most Bactrian 
camels found in the great caravans are 
pack camels. 
Wild Bactrian Camel: Add the Wilder-
ness Sense Virtue and the Greater Im-
munity: Thirst Virtue. Reduce Commu-
nication to –6. Add Defensive Fighter 
(and therefore an extra Fatigue level), 
Fast Runner and Herd Animal Qualities. 
Increase Brawl (dodging) to 4 and add 
Wilderness Sense (sense sandstorms) 3. 
A wild Bactrian camel’s kick has the fol-
lowing statistics: Init +0 Attack +5 De-
fense +3 Damage +4. 
War Camel (variant): Add the Aggres-
sive and Pack Animal Qualities and the 
Ferocity (when ridden in battle) Virtue. 
Increase Brawl (hooves) to 5. A war 
camel’s kick has the following modifi-
cations to the basic combat statistics 
given for either the Bactrian camel 
or a dromedary camel: Init +0 Attack 
+4 Defense +3 Damage +0. It can be 
trained to attack as part of a Trained 
Group with its rider.
Rare Bjornaer magi who are born in 
the southeastern peripheries of Mythic 
Europe have been noted with a drom-
edary or even wild Bactrian camel 
Heartbeast. Camels are considered to 
have a melancholic humor with a cho-
leric aspect.

the Samanid state and was considered 
the heart of Islamic culture and religious 
thought, producing such notables from 
its hinterland as the Persian poets Firdausi 
and Ridauki. Ibn Sina used the famous 
library here and the book bazaars were 
said by al-Biruni to be beyond compare. 
In the 13th century, Bukhara is home to 
a large Jewish community — one of the 
largest non-Hebrew speaking branches 
of the Diaspora.
The half-buried tomb of Isma’il Sa-
manid (r. 893-907), the founder of the 
Samanid dynasty, lies just outside the 
town. Long forgotten by the debauched 
inhabitants, if your saga follows history, 
this building will escape the Mongol dev-
astation as the dust of disuse hides it from 
the horde. A circle in nested squares, a 
Zoroastrian symbol, is carved above the 
main door. The building retains a Magic 
aura of 3 during the night that alternates 
with a similar strength Divine aura during 
the day, due to its former use by Zoroas-
trian mobeds.
The Mongols sack Bukhara at the be-
ginning of 1220 but several sites survive. 
(See the earlier sidebar on “Genghis Khan 
and the Fall of Transoxiana” for further 
details.) The Kalyan minaret is one of the 
few structures of Bukhara still standing af-
ter the Mongol invasion of Transoxiana, 
being spared by Genghis Khan himself. 
A folk story tells of how the great nomad 
stopped to look at the minaret and a gust 
of wind knocked his hat from his head. 
He stooped to pick up his hat and then 
said: “This minaret is the first thing I have 
ever bowed to.” He spared the minaret 
but not the sheikhs, slaying 200 holy men 
and having their heads thrown down the 
nearby well before rising to the pulpit and 
uttering his famous speech.
From the top minaret’s rotunda with 
16 arched fenestrations, the muezzin 
summoned the city’s faithful to prayer or 
warriors kept lookout for enemies. An or-
namental frieze of diagonal brickwork cov-
ered with Arabic inscriptions encircles the 
tower’s base.
The minaret was once part of the larg-
er Po-i-Kalyan mosque complex — the 
immediate ruins retain a Divine aura of 5 
amid the Infernal aura that comes to cover 
most of the city ruins after the sacking. 
Story Seed: Caravans
An immense variety of goods passes 
through Transoxiana in the 13th cen-
tury laden on the packs of asses, cam-
els, horses, or mules, depending on the 
terrain. Huge caravans return from the 
northern lands, carrying goods from 
the steppes of the Volga Bulghars or 
the northern forests, pass through the 
towns of Merv, Baghdad, Samarkand, 
or Khojend, and thence further west to 
Europe via Venetian merchants or east 
via Sogdian merchants to fabled Serica. 
Caravanserais, stone staging posts with 
water supplies and a small garrison, were 
maintained by local rulers at intervals of 
a day’s journey (10 to 15 miles) to sup-
ply the merchant trains. Some caravans 
resembled miniature towns on the move, 
one of the largest ones being noted by 
the geographer Ibn-Fadlan consisted of 
up to 3000 pack animals and 5000 men. 
Such a caravan may become an in-
teresting cover for a covenant of per-
egrinatory Hermetic magi or provide 
protection for a group of native Mythic 
Middle Eastern characters. Either sce-
nario may be a source of varied stories 
based around trade and exploration.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The minaret itself contains a Divine aura 
of 7. By climbing the spiral staircase just 
prior to dawn, a devout Muslim can access 
a small Terrestrial divine regio of strength 
8 that appears as a round chamber above 
the rotunda section. 
Kasri Orifon
A small village just east of Bukhara, this 
site is known for the “wishing tree.” The 
dead trunk of an ancient mulberry tree forms 
a twisted arch in the main square. Barren 
women crawl beneath its trunk in the hope 
of becoming with child. The tree is home 
to a Faerie jinn with powers over fertility — 
passing beneath the wood of the arch leads 
to a small strength 2 Faerie regio just large 
enough for an adult human to enter. 
Otrar
In 1218, a Mongol ambassador ar-
rived at the head of a richly laden cara-
van in this town on the eastern bank of 
the Jaxartes, carrying a message to the 
Khwarazmshah. Governor Inalchuq, a 
cousin of the Khwarazmshah, imprisoned 
and executed the entire caravan of 450 
men, including the ambassador, on the 
basis that he believed they were spies 
or perhaps merely out of greed for their 
valuable wares. The execution of ambas-
sadors was considered a grave insult to 
the Mongol leader — one underlined by 
the subsequent humiliation of the Mon-
gols sent in a second embassy. Through 
this gross insult from a minor official, the 
Mongol horde descended with devastat-
ing effect on the Mawara’n-Nahr.
If your saga follows history, Otrar lasts 
for five months under siege in the first half 
of 1220 before succumbing to Mongol 
Story Seeds for Bukhara and Otrar
The Sheikhs  
Beneath the Well
The Po-i-Kalyan mosque’s well lies 
beneath an octagonal platform nearby. 
If uncovered, explorers can climb down 
the dry shaft to the base, which contains 
a pile of loosely stacked skulls within 
a small Magic aura of strength 3. Each 
skull acts as an Arcane Connection to 
the sheikh it once belonged to and can 
be used to summon the restless spirit of 
that particular holy man. Beneath the 
base of the minaret itself lies the grave 
of an imam ritually slain by the tower’s 
builder, Arslan Khan.
The Lost Books of Bukhara
After the Mongols raze Bukhara in 
early 1220, several rumors circulate as to 
the fate of the various book collections 
and libraries. Much poetry is written la-
menting the loss of this great collection 
of scholarly works, comparing it to the 
burning of the Great Library of Alexan-
dria. Such tales, woven over the years by 
gifted poets and the Merinita magi of the 
Keepers of Tales Mystery Cult, attract 
faeries to the story. Eventually, the col-
lective lamentation may provide enough 
vitality to reproduce a Faerie replica of 
the library. Access to such a place would 
be greatly sought after by mundane, 
Hermetic and sahir scholars searching 
for lost secrets and classical knowledge. 
The faeries associated with the library 
take the form of rare books, appearing un-
expectedly in market stalls run by eccentric 
merchants or being found serendipitously 
in the disused sections of old mundane li-
braries. The books themselves are Faerie 
creatures and act as Threshold Guardians 
— by reading the Faerie text and wishing 
to rediscover the lost library, the readers 
find themselves in Arcadia. Such stories 
are always tinged with tragedy and sad-
ness, for a reader may visit the library but 
once and leave with only a small token of 
his travel and memories to spread the leg-
end of the Lost Library further within the 
hearts of scholars throughout Mythic Eu-
rope. Such loss and longing provides fur-
ther vitality to the faeries of the library, as 
its story weaves into similar tales and cre-
ates a lasting motif through the centuries.
Job’s Spring
At the edge of Bukhara’s farmers’ mar-
ket lies a small mausoleum, the Chash-
ma-Ayyub, recently built over a small 
strength 3 Faerie aura containing a small 
spring. Unlike other mausoleums, no 
one is buried within its walls. Local folk-
lore describes it as the place where Job 
struck his staff to the ground and called 
forth water, but perhaps the legend just 
represents the adoption of an older pa-
gan tradition. Visited annually by one 
of the sahirs of the local bayt al-hikma 
who sponsored the recent construction, 
the resident Faerie jinn can be bargained 
with for the faerie-tainted Terram and 
Aquam vis produced by re-enacting the 
ancient story within its walls. When the 
local sahir goes missing, who is to blame 
— angered jinn or a jealous rival seeking 
to usurp the vis source? 
Uqana, the  
Ghostly Ambassador
The ambassador of the first embassy 
to the Khwarazmshah was Uqana, a 
Muslim merchant trusted with a per-
sonal message of friendship from the 
great Khan. His execution at the hands 
of a fellow Muslim has resulted in a rest-
less spirit, trapped as an apparition after 
death (see Realms of Power: Magic, page 
115, for details of this class of ghost). 
Although the great Khan has avenged 
his murder, Uqana is unable to rest, as 
his spirit feels he failed in his duty to de-
liver his message. Convincing the trau-
matized ghost to depart to his proper 
rest will be difficult, given the wake of 
destruction that the Mongols have left 
since their affront at Otrar. If compelled 
by magical means, Uqana may provide 
valuable information about the inten-
tions and plans of the Mongol leaders. 
Attempting such magical coercion or 
lying convincingly to gain the former 
ambassador’s trust may have grave con-
sequences within the Infernal aura that 
encompasses his haunt.

forces. Inalchuq is captured alive but exe-
cuted by having molten silver poured into 
his eyes and ears. The town is reduced to 
rubble and its population slain or enslaved, 
a prelude to the fate of the other towns 
in the region. Its ruins contain a Perfidious 
Infernal aura of strength 6, tarnished with 
the sin of Deceit. Lies told within the ruins 
seem more believable — attempts to spot 
a lie have their Ease Factor increased by 
the aura strength. 
Khwarazm
A province of canals and gardens, Kh-
warazm is the agricultural heart of Tran-
soxiana and the home to the bellicose 
Khwarazmshah whose actions brought 
down the wrath of the Mongol hordes, 
Sultan Mohammed II Iskander. It pro-
duces large crops of cotton, sustains large 
flocks of sheep for wool, and pastures 
great herds of cattle in the marshlands 
among its multitude of canals. Its main 
industry is trade, including expensive 
Elephants in Persia
The elephant was considered a prize 
war animal by the Persian armies of an-
tiquity. Small numbers are still found 
throughout the eastern reaches in the 
possession of nobles or the Khwarazm 
military, the former as curiosities and the 
latter as part of shock troops. Elephants 
are legendary opponents of dragons and 
fearlessly attack serpents at any opportu-
nity, but are deathly afraid of the squeal 
of a sow or boar and will flee this sound 
unless restrained.

Story Seed:  
Elephants of Alexander 
The ghosts of ancient war elephants 
can be summoned at the battle sites of 
antiquity throughout Arabia, Persia, and 
Transoxiana, using their bones to call 
them back to unearthly service. Such 
sites are of particular interest to House 
Tremere, who seek to expand the versa-
tility and power of their ghostly forces.
Faerie war elephants from the land 
of Hind, as used in the armies of Al-
exander the Great, appear even larger 
and more fearsome than their mundane 
kin. Such creatures sport multiple large 
curved tusks and have been trained to 
wield spiked balls on chains with their 
trunks. They prompt panic in lesser 
creatures and are capable of deafening 
opponents with their trumpeting. The 
remains of these giant creatures are 
found primarily in the far mountains of 
the eastern provinces and the southern 
deserts of Persia.

furs from the lands of the Bulghars to the 
north. Khwarazm is particularly known 
for its Turkish slaves, however, and is the 
center of the slave trade in Transoxiana. 
Young nomads are bought or stolen from 
the steppes, given an Islamic education, 
and then dispatched to the far corners of 
the Islamic Empire.
Gurganj
A leading town along the trade 
routes, the town of Gurganj or Al-Jur-
janiyah has shifted its site on the west-
ern bank of the river over the years to 
accommodate the vagaries of the flood-
waters of the Oxus and the vengeance of 
the native river spirits.
If your saga follows history, the Mon-
gols besiege Gurganj in 1220, breaking 
the massive dyke in frustration after five 
months and unleashing the pent-up wa-
ters of the Oxus. Once again, the city 
falls to the onrushing waters and the 
great river resumes its flow into the Cas-
pian Sea, releasing the enslaved magical 
spirits upon their former Khwarazmian 
captors (see the sidebar on Spirits of the 
Oxus Delta, earlier). All that will remain 
after the Mongols march away from the 
town are sundry corpses and the ruined 
walls that sketch the outline of the once-
great city.
Kath
Former capital of Khwarazm and orig-
inal home of the native Khwarazmshah 
dynasty, this once-magnificent city on 
the eastern bank of the Oxus has suffered 
repeated flooding throughout its history, 
washing it into secondary rank.
Overlooking a great necropolis to the 
north stands the mausoleum of Il-Arslan.
Farghana
To the northeast of Sogdiana lie the 
open plains of the vast valley of Farghana, 
the most eastern point reached by the initial 
wave of expansion sparked by Islam. Famous 
for its horses, metal goods, and particularly 
its weapons, it also has fine oil and bitumen. 
Arab armies are using clay pipes filled with 
oil as incendiaries in sieges, a tactic later ad-
opted by their Mongol conquerors.
The Heavenly Horse of Farghana
The valley at the headwaters of the 
Jaxartes has been known for its excel-
lent horses since antiquity. According 
to legend, the horses of Farghana are 
offspring of mundane horses and either 
mountain river dragons or other seem-
ingly divine steeds that visited the wild 
steppe herds in the past. Such “Heav-
enly Horses” appear similar to the Ara-
bian-descended horses of the European 
nobility but are slightly larger. These 
Faerie animals are particularly sought 
after by magi and Gifted sahirs due to 
their suitability as mounts for Gifted 
magicians, and local tales tell of rep-
resentatives from Serica traveling vast 
distances to procure even one of these 
amazing mounts.

do this across open water or chasms 
without needing to slow its pace. 
ReAn 25 (Base 10, Sun +2, +1 Con-

Appearance: These horses appear similar 
to other mid-sized breeds of charger, 
although even an experienced horse 
trainer will find it difficult to ascer-
tain its origin. Usual specimens stand 
just under 16 hands (62 inches) high 
but appear more refined than even 
the finest mundane horse.
These Faerie mounts are believed to 
be descended from river dragons east of 
the valley of Farghana. Unlike mundane 
horses, they are not affected by the neg-
ative effects of The Gift or Magical Air 
of their riders. Even a Blatant Gift does 
not especially bother the animal. 
These Faerie horses are also re-
nowned for their unusual trait of 
sweating blood. The crimson sweat 
is produced by any significant physi-
cal exertion, but does no harm to the 
creature. If properly collected over the 
course of a year, such sweat acts as a Vis 
Source and provides 1 pawn of faerie-
tainted Animal vis per year. As a faerie, 
it does not suffer from fatigue or age, 
although it does suffer the usual conse-
quences if it lacks air, food, and water in 
its role as a magical steed.
Like all horses, a Heavenly Horse 
gets a +3 to all rolls involving running 
or jumping. These creatures are not bal-
anced to be used as player characters.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Khojend
Framed at the mouth of the Farghana 
valley, this small trade town is built near the 
ruins of Alexandria Eschate: the furthest 
settlement established by Alexander the 
Great in his campaign of conquests. Anoth-
er Altar of Alexander lies hidden beneath 
the city or within the adjacent ruins (see 
Ruins at Ai Khanoum earlier for details). 
Osh
Located just downstream from the 
source of the Jaxartes in the Pamir moun-
tains, Osh is the easternmost settlement in 
the Farghana valley and the northernmost 
town of the Islamic Caliphate, making it the 
end of certainty and the starting point for 
stories of exploration past the map’s edge. 
Osh is the last caravan stop on the 
Great Khurasan Road from Baghdad. 
Merchants follow tales and legends rather 
than tracks as they climb into the eastern 
mountains on their way to the fabled Fa-
erie city of Khashgar and thence by the 
dreaded desert route to legendary Serica.
Badakhshan
Fabled for its rubies, sapphires, and 
other jewels, this mountainous region rises 
upwards into the Caucasus Indicus south 
of a great northern loop of the Oxus, 
transected by its main tributary, the Nahr 
Dirgham (Badakhshan or Kokchka River). 
Known in antiquity as Balascia, classical 
geographers place it on the north face 
of the southeastern slopes of legendary 
Mount Imeon. Now free from the demon-
ic yoke of the Shansabani of Maiyan to the 
south, it is one of the borderlands of the 
ancient world known to the traders who 
traverse it from northwest to southeast.
Wakhan 
This narrow territory follows the Oxus 
River from lower Badakhshan back to its 
mythical source. It is inhabited by reclu-
sive pastoralists known as the Vakhi who 
speak an almost unintelligible dialect of 
Parsi (–3 penalty to Ability score). Since 
Badakhshan Story Seeds
The Faerie Road to Serica
Unlike the lower reaches, the whole 
upper valley of the Oxus past its junction 
with the Badakhshan River is covered by a 
extremely lengthy but narrow Faerie aura 
bounded by the sharp mountain crest lines 
to the north and south. Beginning with a 
weak aura of only 2 at the outskirts of Ai 
Khanoum, the aura increases gradually as 
a traveler climbs further east. At the level 
of the Wakhan Valley proper, the aura has 
reached a strength of 6 and the Warping 
it induces is partly responsible for the 
taciturn nature of the nomads (Reclusive 
Minor Flaw). Multiple Faerie regiones 
can be accessed from the path, depend-
ing on the traveler’s mood, goals, and 
particular Faerie Sympathies (see Realms of 
Power: Faerie for further details). Some of 
these regiones lead only to blind canyons 
and certain death, while others contain 
whole lost kingdoms and cities built on 
the shores of a great encroaching des-
ert. The most sought-after paths provide 
portals into the various worlds of Faerie. 
Those leading to Arcadia are commonest 
although a solitary traveler is more likely 
to be drawn into Eudokia to resolve the 
crisis that has led them to flee beyond the 
bounds of Hermetic knowledge.
Itineris Serica
Cartophilius of Mercere has always 
been regarded as eccentric, even among 
Mercere magi. His father, Geographicus, 
was one of the founders of a similar travel-
ing covenant, so it is perhaps unsurprising 
he has proposed forming another mobile 
gathering of magi at the recent Normandy 
Tribunal meeting. The covenant’s mun-
dane cover as a merchant caravan is noth-
ing new, but his intent to seek funding as 
a dedicated research covenant surprised 
even the archmagi who knew his parens. 
Cartophilius intends nothing less 
than to find the true source of silk by 
traveling eastward to mythical Serica.
Several members argued against his 
plan, stating that no precedent for such a 
Seeker covenant exists, but, surprisingly, 
the Exarch of House Tremere guaranteed 
full support for such an expedition and 
volunteered two experienced Tremere 
magi to accompany the Mercere’s ven-
ture. Whether the Exarch’s motives were 
out of true support or just a pragmatic 
solution to finding an outlet for the more 
enthusiastic members of the Burning 
Acorn Vexillation remains in doubt.
This covenant may provide an inter-
esting high fantasy or high Faerie diver-
sion from the usual “castle on the hill by 
the Faerie wood” trope that is the default 
of many Ars Magica sagas. Possible cov-
enant magi might include a Nestorian Tri-
anoma spy, a Turkish Criamon Sufi master, 
and a Levantine Merinita jinn specialist. 
The Gutluk-Temir Minaret
The tallest brick minaret of the 
Mythic Middle East, this structure rises 
to over 180 feet, providing a dominat-
ing view of the surrounding irrigated 
province. Despite the religious style, 
it is surrounded by a Magic aura of 7 
and forms the focus of the magical net-
work of fetters and wards that binds the 
various Oxus river spirits to the dykes 
noted earlier. The protective magics of 
the minaret are maintained by the lo-
cal community of sahirs, who use the 
structure as their meeting place and 
ensure the canals continue to support 
the province’s famed fertility. The sahir 
community lies directly in the path of 
the onrushing Mongol horde — the few 
survivors may be some of the first Solo-
monic magi to bear news to their breth-
ren in the west.

The Cradle & The Crescent
antiquity, a trade route has wound its 
way up this valley and on to the mythical 
land of Serica, although no merchant yet 
claims to have traveled the whole journey 
there and back again. On occasion, exot-
ic travelers and pilgrims have appeared in 
the Mythic Middle East, claiming to have 
traversed the corridor westwards, reciting 
tales of their adventures in the mountains 
and stories about the fabled cities of their 
homelands in the desolate Taklimakan 
desert beyond.
Blue Stones of Mythic Europe
Commonly mistaken for sapphire in 
period, lapis lazuli’s name derives from 
the Latin lapis (“stone”) and a corruption 
of the Persian name of its town of origin, 
Lahzvard (Latin lazulum, “from Lahzvard”). 
Its use in amulets, scarabs, and even seals 
is documented in various Egyptian and 
Babylonian magical texts. It is also an es-
sential ingredient in the pigment ultrama-
rine. Such pure pigment is greatly valued 
for the illumination of Hermetic texts as a 
highly resonant material, although a less-
er pigment made from locally available 
mineral referred to as kuanos, or cerulean 
(azurite), is often substituted. 
Pliny’s description of sapphiros flecked 
with gold is believed by many Hermetic 
lapidary specialists to refer to lapis rather 
than sapphire (blue corundum). Lapis la-
zuli has the following shape and material 
bonuses: +3 aphrodisiac (when ground as 
a powder), +5 keep limbs healthy, +5 cure 
boils and ulcers, +6 versus the Obsession 
power of demons. A Lapis Lazuli of Vir-
tue contains 2 pawns of Corpus vis. When 
Enriched by carving it in the shape of an 
eye, set in gold, and placed as an offering 
on the last day of the month on an altar 
dedicated to the Egyptian deity Ra, it con-
fers the Minor Supernatural Virtue Lesser 
Immunity (obsession power of demons) 
(ArM5, page 45). Alternatively, it can be 
smelted in a crucible with lead to remove 
its gold flecks. When the result is ground 
to fine powder and applied to the eyelids, 
it acts as a potent aphrodisiac equivalent 
to the wearer having the Venus’ Blessing 
Minor General Virtue (ArM5, page 50).
At the Troupe’s discretion, only blue 
gems from beyond the bounds of Mythic 
Europe may provide the proper “sap-
phire” bonuses — a potential story idea 
is that such blue stones may have to be 
discovered in dreams, Faerie, the Magic 
realm or as the result of looting dragon 
hoards. Details of Sapphires of Virtue are 
given in Realms of Power: Magic, page 127. 
Story Seed: Untouched Stone
A senior magus seeks the charac-
ters’ help with a delicate problem. His 
attempts to stabilize his new longevity 
potion require a blue stone the same 
size as the magus himself as a compo-
nent, but the cerulean he is using is in-
adequate for the task. Citing Pliny as 
an authority, he has determined that 
he requires the classical sapphiros. The 
stone must be freshly born, at least hu-
man-sized, and remain untouched by 
human hands. Magical manipulation is 
out, as the resonance will be destroyed 
if the rock is affected by magic prior to 
the ritual.
Mining a correctly-shaped hunk of 
lapis lazuli using indirect magic or mun-
dane means may not represent a great 
problem, but delivering such a rock to 
the magus all the way from the mines 
of Lahzvard in Badakhshan presents a 
problem. The only guaranteed option is 
traveling by mundane means through the 
eastern Caliphate. Given the tumult of 
the area in the aftermath of the Mongol 
incursion, such an expedition is bound to 
present several challenges, not least the 
risk from bandits or nomads seeking to 
haul off what is a rather difficult-to-con-
ceal small fortune.

The Cradle & The Crescent
The Mines of Lahzvard
The limestone deposits along the Ba-
dakhshan River at Lahzvard are the only 
source of lapis lazuli known in Mythic Eu-
rope. The greedy jinn of Zubaydah, a fort 
named after the favored wife of Caliph 
Haroun al-Rashid, oversee the main mine 
works. From here, strongly guarded ship-
ments of lapis lazuli travel west to supply 
European artists and magi or are sent east 
into the fabled lands of Hind, Serica, and 
perhaps even the adjoining mountainous 
regions of Faerie.
The Roof of the World
The Bam-i-Dunya, or “Roof of the 
World,” refers to the high plateaus of 
the Pamir knot, the northwestern Cau-
casus Indicus, and the ranges that extend 
southward and eastward into lands out-
side the Dar al-Islam (“House of Islam”). 
The civilizations spawned in the valleys 
cradled below the peaks have tradition-
ally been the middlemen in interactions 
between the Roman and Persian Empires 
to the west and the mysterious land of 
Serica in the east. 
Islamic mythology claims this chain 
of stone as part of the Mountains of 
Qaf and thus one of the homelands of 
the jinn. Valleys strewn with fist-sized 
diamonds are the roost of the great ruq, 
massive eagles that can lift a man in one 
of their claws and carry him away like a 
small mouse.
In classical texts, the crests of this re-
gion are the lesser flanks of Mount Imeon, 
the mountain at the center of the world, 
considered by some Criamon magi as 
the possible original location of the Axis 
Magica prior to Criamon’s ascendance 
into Twilight.
The whole area is covered by a un-
spoiled Magic aura of at least 4, although 
areas with higher auras and regiones of 
other Realms punctuate its icy expanses.

Appearance: The ruq appears as a gigan-
tic eagle, with steel-bright eyes and 
cruelly curved talons. These statistics 
represent one of the smaller speci-
mens, standing just over 25 feet tall 
with a wingspan just over 40 feet. 
Although a magnificent creature, a 
ruq (or roc) is not a Beast of Virtue and 
is not designed to be a player charac-
ter. This ruq is based on a large falcon 
or eagle (Size –2) with a base Might of 
15 advanced to gigantic proportions. 
This specimen is large enough to carry 
off livestock, horses and humans. Larger 
specimens (Size +8) have been seen to 
carry off elephants and even giants. 
Golden Eagles: Used by the eastern 
Turks and Mongols, the large burkit (Size 
–2) of the steppe are used to hunt foxes 
and can even be trained to attack wolves. 
Although similar in appearance to ruq, 
such eagles use the base characteristics of 
a falcon given in the Book of Mundane Beasts 
but have the additional Qualities: Grapple 
and Imposing Appearance x2. Oversized 
eagles (up to Size 0) are sometimes used 
by the Ghuzz magic-kin and have their 
characteristics modified accordingly for 
their size (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia).

The Cradle & The Crescent
Turris Lapidae, the Stone Tower
Ptolemy’s Geography mentions the 
small mountain kingdom of Sarikol as the 
stopping point for caravans heading east-
wards towards the fabled Sera Metropo-
lis, the capital of the Seres. Some say the 
overlooking fort marks the halfway point 
between Europe and the lands of the East, 
others claim it is a town half in the mun-
dane world, half in the Faerie Realm that 
provides a gateway into Arcadia. Descrip-
tions stem from the merchant traveler, 
Maes Titanos, although his report is con-
sidered suspect by Ptolemy’s source, the 
pre-Hermetic wizard Marinus of Tyre who 
regards the figure of Titanos as a fabrica-
tion, Faerie, or an infernalist. 
In the Mythic world, this sizable town 
marks the extent of classical travel to the 
east and is thus one of the mundane geo-
graphical limits of the Order’s knowledge 
of the world. No Redcap or Mercere magus 
claims to have yet visited this mythical site 
or entered the fabled tower, leading some 
Merinita magi to speculate that while it 
still lies within the mundane world, it can 
only be reached by passing along the Ar-
cadian paths known to House Merinita. 
Beyond the  
Roof of the World
Travelers’ tales tell of fantastical crea-
tures found just beyond the eastern peaks. 
After the mountains comes the desert, 
studded by prosperous oasis towns and ru-
ins of lost civilizations. Searing heat, cruel 
winds, and malicious demons populate 
these stories, and all contribute to luring 
travelers from their caravans into lingering 
deaths from starvation and hunger. 
Khashgar
Of all the legendary cities associated 
with the eastern journey, Khashgar is per-
haps the most widely known in the 13th 
century. Routes from north and south con-
verge on this mythical oasis city before 
branching around the dreaded Taklimakan 
desert on their way eastward to the Land 
of Silk. Scholars debate its origin and exact 
location but all agree its streets teem with 
humans, jinn, and other Eastern faeries 
mixing shoulder to shoulder with angels, 
demons, and non-Hermetic sorcerers.
Nominally Muslim since the late ninth 
century, Khashgar suffered repression and 
intolerance under the Eastern faeries of the 
Qara Khitai dynasty, but has recently fall-
en under the Mongol yoke without resis-
tance. The inhabitants, both mundane and 
magical, appear to have taken the change 
in overlords without much concern. 
Famous for the Yekshenbar bazaar 
(“Sunday market”), the city is a place where 
all manner of exotic goods can be bought 
or sold. Desert brigands mix with worn 
merchants; exotic silks, knives, and jew-
elry are displayed alongside more magical 
Ruq Story Seeds
The Ruq’s Nest
Faerie ruq also exist, typically acting as 
Threshold Guardians involving the Path 
of Chance and stories within Arcadia. 
Characters attempting to flee the bird’s ap-
proach may suffer grievous wounds, while 
those snatched up by the great raptors 
find themselves cast into strange stories 
in distant lands, much like the legendary 
Sinbad the Sailor. Stories tell of whole val-
leys within regiones beneath their nests 
lined with diamonds as large as a man’s fist, 
populated by giant-sized Faerie sheep and 
goats. Successful adventurers who escape 
to mundane lands may claim such gem-
stones as the prize for their courage — dif-
ferent gems contain differently-flavored 
vis according to their nature, although 
such vis is always Faerie tainted.
The Faerie versions differ only in 
that they possess the Spirit Away Power 
and replace the (Cloud) Regio Network 
with the Faerie Speech Virtue, which al-
lows them to fulfill their role as catalysts 
of high adventure.
Janaindar, the City  
Above the Clouds 
Local nomad legends speak of a lost 
city built at the edge of the Magic Realm, 
seen rising above the clouds atop a great 
mountain peak on a clear day and all but 
inaccessible except by magic, or being 
carried to its aerie by one of the great 
ruq. The stories say its alien inhabitants 
claim descent from an ancient magical 
race that once ruled over the earth, al-
though they appear human in guise.
Is this a lost Nephilim settlement? 
The true location of Hyperborea in 
Turkistan? An ancient and reclusive cov-
enant of elder magi? The descendents 
of a rival magical tradition founded by 
Trianoma’s sister, Viea? The last refuge of 
the Zoroastrian mobeds? A potential site 
for a high-fantasy Hermetic covenant 
above the clouds? The last sanctum of 
the Diedne?
Story Seed: The Black and the Blue
The dunes off the main track are 
feared as the abode of the qara buran 
(“black 
hurricanes”), 
bloodthirsty 
wind spirits that assail caravans as 
mighty sandstorms, separating trav-
elers from their camels and compan-
ions. These untamable buran closely 
resemble elemental jinn in nature, but 
some creatures appear more akin to 
Infernal Aerial Powers than to Magi-
cal spirits (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). 
The storm spirits divide their loyalty 
between the great Gök Buran — a 
frighteningly powerful Daimon that 
dwells within an even stronger Magic 
regio deep within the center of the 
sands — and its rival, a Duke of Hell 
known as Great Lop.

wares. Slaves, both mundane and magical, 
can be found here, for a price. 
Some Merinita claim to have visited the 
Khashgar market in traveling through Arca-
dia, and suggest several versions of the city 
may exist at once, or that the whole town 
may lie in a regio accessed from several dif-
ferent mundane sites in Mythic Europe. 
Ignoring the scholars and their musings, 
life and commerce goes on in Khashgar.
The Taklimakan
This magical desert is a place of death 
— its name translates as “those who go in, 
never come out.” A pair of geographically 
shifting auras of constant strength 7 (one 
Infernal, one Magical) swirl and intertwine 
across the sands as opposing storms. The 
two spiral-shaped auras constantly enve-
lope and then reveal ancient Faerie regios, 
which either contain the ruins of long-de-
serted cities or thriving oases populated by 
jinn from before the coming of Islam. 
The Mythic 
Steppe
Untamed grasslands stretch for almost 
unimaginable distances along the edge of 
the Mythic Middle East, and from them 
pour the Mongol hordes.
The Great Steppe
Even at its height, the Eastern Roman 
Empire reached only the fringes of the vast 
ocean of grassland that stretches the breadth 
of the continent of Asia, from the Sea of 
Azov and the great gulf of grass forming 
the Hungarian plain in the west to the Or-
dos, and extending to the limitless horizon 
in the east. Herodotus refers to the littoral 
of this grass lake as Scythia but speaks of 
its endless and timeless nature — no con-
tinuous landscape feature encountered by 
Hermetic magi is on the same scale. 
Tashkent
The Turkish “City of Stone,” once the 
greatest Arab town beyond the Jaxartes, 
was laid to waste by the vengeful Mongol 
hordes in 1219, although the Khwarazm-
shah had already sacked much of it in 1214. 
Like other towns in the area, it was a city of 
canals, famous for its vineyards. It formed 
a trade center between the latter-day Sog-
dians and their nomadic Turkic neighbors 
until the recent Mongol incursion. It is al-
ready beginning to be resettled and recov-
er its trade position under Mongol lordship 
and marks the frontier between civilization 
and the barbarian wilderness.
Talas
In July 751 the Muslim armies led by 
Ziya ben Salih met a strange expedition-
ary force from beyond the eastern steppes. 
Although less significant than the Battle of 
Poitiers in 732 in the west, this confronta-
tion marked the easternmost expansion of 
the Arab armies.

The majority of horses in the Eastern 
Provinces are the small but hardy ponies 
of the steppe’s nomad tribes. They are 
notably different than larger breeds com-
monly used in Europe, Arabia, and south-
ern Persia presented in the Book of Mundane 
Beasts and Lords of Men, Chapter 5: Leisure.
Steppe ponies are bred from the wild 
horses of the Steppe by the various no-
mad tribes that range across it. Excep-
tional Steppe ponies with the Minor 
Heroic Virtues Great Bearer and Sure 
Traveler (see Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, 
pages 105-107) are highly prized by the 
Steppe nomads. Like all light horses, a 
Steppe pony is a fast runner and gets a +3 
to rolls involving running or jumping.
Story Seed: The Endless Nomad Cycle
The ruins of an old nomad fortress lie 
near the old town of Talas. Just outside is 
the terminus of a road from Arcadia that 
leads to a Faerie reflection of the Mythic 
Steppe. Throughout history, since before 
the time of Alexander, waves of Faerie 
nomads summoned by the great Jaxartes 
river spirit have descended upon the 
lands of Transoxiana in an eternal cycle 
of destruction that echoes in the memo-
ries and folktales of the people who dwell 
in the lands beyond the Oxus. Each suc-
cessive wave carries a slightly different 
name but brings new terror — the recur-
ring story they enact breaking upon the 
shores of civilization through eternity. 
The Mongols may merely represent the 
latest retelling of the ancient story — see 
“Gog and Magog” in the sidebar later for 
further ideas.

in this campaign. The technology of pa-
permaking passed into the Islamic world 
from such captives, with the first paper 
mill being built in Samarkand shortly af-
ter. Nearly five centuries later, the last Kh-
warazmshah, Muhammad II, defeated the 
Faerie forces of the mysterious Kara-Khi-
tai nomad dynasty in 1218 to consolidate 
his rule over Transoxiana. The town was 
razed completely in 1219 by the Mongol 
armies on their way to Otrar.

Appearance: A fierce-looking eastern 
warrior on horseback, his upper body 
lightly covered by fur-lined leather 
armor, with an acorn-like metal hel-
met also fringed with fur. He carries 
a bow in a quiver on his saddle, a 
saber, and a short spear with a small 
hook at the base of the blade.
While there are younger soldiers in 
the Mongol army, this trooper represents 
the finest specimen that the characters are 
likely to encounter, the sort of character 
who would fight in the vanguard during 
a group engagement, or who might be 
found singly acting as a scout or guard.
Leading such troopers are experi-
enced generals — usually regular war-
riors with exceptional talent rather than 
blood relatives of the Mongol royal 
family — or hereditary chieftains. The 
Mongolian generals are experts in strat-
egy and tactics, and most of their suc-
cesses may be attributed to their superior 
military intelligence and their ability to 
quickly assess the nature of the battle-
field. Many of their enemies are fooled 
by a carefully staged organized retreat, 
their finest maneuver, wherein they seem 
to pull back and draw their opponents 
out behind them in a long pursuit to 
exhaust them, before suddenly turning 
around and attacking.
An orlock (Mongol general) can be cre-
ated as an older Companion-level char-
acter based on the Mongol trooper tem-
plate earlier, with the following changes 
as an example. Adjust the characteristics 
to Int 0, Per +1, Pre +2 (1), Com +1, Str 
0, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik 0 due to posses-
sion of the Improved Characteristics Vir-
tue. An example orlock might have the 
following additional Virtues and Flaws: 
Affinity with Leadership, Clear Thinker, 
Improved Characteristics, Inspirational, 
Puissant Ability (Leadership), Self-Con-
fident, Strong-Willed; Enemies (Mythic 
Middle East), Outsider, Vow (loyalty to 
Genghis Khan). They lack the Puissant 
Ability (Bows) Virtue and Reckless Flaw 
of their troops. Their Confidence score 
is increased to 2(5) and they have the 
following Personality Traits: Resolute 
+3, Ruthless +5, Cunning +4. The aver-
age age of an orlock is 40 and they have 
the following additional Abilities: Artes 
Liberales 1 (military communication), 
Craft Siege Equipment 3 (catapults or 
mangonels), Folk Ken 2 (nobles), Guile 
3 (elaborate lies), Intrigue 3 (alliances), 
Leadership 6+2 (7)(battlefield), Persian 
3 (negotiations). They lack the Bar-
gain ability of the common trooper and 
have their Bows score reduced to only 
5. Their Soak, Fatigue Levels, Wound 
Penalties, Equipment and Encumbrance 
remain unchanged but their combat sta-
tistics will need to be appropriately ad-
justed. Individual generals encountered 
may have slightly different Virtues, 
Flaws and Abilities.

The Cradle & The Crescent
Great Sky.” Like the original spirit of the 
Hercynian Forest (see Guardians of the Forest, 
Chapter 3: The Forest, pages 30–40) in the 
far west, the Great Tengri of the Steppe is 
a powerful supernatural entity that draws 
its power from the Magic realm. To Her-
metic understanding, this primal spirit is 
similar to a Kosmokrator of the Steppe 
and the Sky, an Elder Daimon that governs 
the vast grass sea of the Mythic Steppe.
Lesser Steppe Spirits
Magic Might: 30-45 (Auram, Terram, 
or rarely Aquam or Herbam). 
All are considered genii loci of their 
particular steppe.
Typical Powers: Creator of Winds or 
Earth, Guide, Manifestation, Presence, 
Ruler of Winds or Earth. All Steppe Spirits 
possess the Ways of the Steppe Virtue and 
some have the ability to Grant Major Super-
natural Virtues to their chosen messengers. 
At its settled fringes, where the Great 
Steppe has begun to fray under the ad-
vance of settled communities, the Great 
Tengri has engendered lesser spirits at 
the cost of some of its own power. These 
lesser spirits are considered genii loci of 
a particular region, stretches of grassland 
that can range in size from a small valley, 
to the size of a large European kingdom. 
Three possible fates await such lesser frag-
ment spirits. 
Survival: The genius locus of the local 
steppe is strong enough to hold its own 
against the encroachment of the mundanes 
and the Dominion. These spirits give rise 
to magical steppes, such as the southeast 
plains of Russia around the Sea of Azov, 
the Dzungarian depression, and the dis-
tant eastern plains of Mongolia. Between 
such peripheries, the Great Steppe spirit 
rules unchecked, only slightly diminished 
in power. Beyond these buffers, only lesser 
nature spirits and faeries are found.

Appearance: An easterner dressed in a 
collection of tattered cloth, feath-
ers, and beads, carrying a ceremonial 
drum and stick. Closer inspection re-
veals his clothing is reversed.
A few of the Mongols in the army are 
tribal shamans of Great Tengri, the Mon-
gol sky god. Versed in the power of the 
spirit world, they can summon spirits to 
aid them by scouting out the area, attack-
ing supernatural enemies, and spying on 
their opponents. The rules on Solomon-
ic Summoning in Chapter 3: The Or-
der of Suleiman can be used as a guide, 
and more complex rules for summoning 
spirits in this way are found in Realms of 
Power: The Infernal, pages 114–115. For 
the sake of simplicity, you may assume 
that the shaman can easily summon an 
appropriate Faerie, Magical, or Infernal 
spirit of Might 30 or less and bargain 
with it to convince it to do his bidding. 
These spirits might agree to be bound to 
a weapon, creating a sort of enchanted 
device, or commanded to perform a task 
for the shaman. The shamans employ 
whatever sort of spirit is convenient to 
help them accomplish their objectives, 
even demons.
All shamans have a personal famil-
iar spirit, similar to the qareen noted in 
Chapter 4: The Jinn. This is usually an an-
cestor spirit associated with their home-
land that follows them and aids them. 
For examples of these sorts of beings and 
the powers they have at their command, 
see The Mysteries: Revised Edition or Realms of 
Power: Magic or use the jinn as a guide to 
creating various elemental spirits.
Note that these hedge wizards dif-
fer somewhat from the original shamans 
presented in Ancient Magic, page 18.

The Cradle & The Crescent
steppe is too small to maintain its control 
over the steppe, or else it borders on more 
powerful areas that sap its strength until 
nothing remains. These spirits leave be-
hind a mundane steppe. Examples include 
Pannonia, where the effects of the nearby 
Dominion of the Byzantine Empire have 
forced the lesser steppe spirits to flee into 
the deeper steppe. Likewise, the Hungar-
ian plain, hemmed in by the arc of the 
Carpathians, where the formerly nomadic 
Magyars have settled, has also been sapped 
of its remaining strength, becoming an 
isolated promontory of Divine pasture.
Replacement: The genius locus has 
dwindled and been replaced by another 
supernatural being. This most commonly 
gives rise to a Faerie steppe at the edges of 
Mythic Mongols Story Seeds
Dark Angels of Punishment
The possibility of an Infernal Mon-
gol horde may appeal to some troupes. 
Perhaps the nomad leader and his gener-
als are the mortal incarnations of pow-
erful Angels of Punishment, demons of 
the Order of Avengers of Evil posing as 
Divine retribution (Realms of Power: The 
Infernal, pages 39–40). The accompany-
ing shamans may be Infernally-aligned 
human summoners or even fully-fledged 
diabolists, but the majority of the horde 
may still be composed of mundane no-
mads. Instead of an Angel of Punishment, 
Genghis Khan may be a startling incar-
nation of the new Zahhak, possessed by 
the ancient demonic foe of Persia, Azi 
Dahak (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia).
For more high-fantasy Sagas with a 
strong Infernal theme, the horde may 
contain true demons of destruction and 
other Infernal creatures. This latter op-
tion is recommended only for high-pow-
ered troupes who are willing to explore a 
heavily Infernal-themed Saga.
Spawn of Gog and Magog
Another alternative is that the Mon-
gol horde has ridden out of Arcadia, the 
latest incarnation of a recurring story 
that manifests the fears of nomad bru-
tality and avarice held by the agrarian 
settlers along the steppe frontier since 
ancient times. From the biblical hordes 
of Gog and Magog, then Goths, then the 
Huns and the Avars, the recent Magyars, 
and now the Mongols, such cyclic dark 
Faerie incursions are repeated through-
out the history of the region. 
In this scenario, Genghis Khan may 
be the latest role played by a dark Faerie 
Monarch, with his generals and officials 
represented by the other powerful court 
faeries (see Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 
80–83). The rank and file of the Mongol 
horde may contain variants of lesser Faer-
ie Knights, Faerie-touched humans, and 
mundane human nomads. In a high-fan-
tasy saga, the horse archers of the horde 
may be led by Faerie centaurs, or contain 
whole troops of such faeries rather than 
the mundane Mongol Trooper detailed 
earlier. The shamans and tributary magi-
cians accompanying the horde would be 
represented by Faerie Wizards skilled in 
the Artes Fabulosa, or perhaps true Fa-
eries with powers that can equal, and in 
some cases exceed, Hermetic magic.
Prester John, I Presume?
A more positive take on the Faerie 
horde may involve the nomads as the 
soldiers of Prester John, the Christian 
King of the East, born out of the legends 
of the Crusades. The exact source of the 
legend is unclear, but may relate to cor-
rupted rumors of Sultan Sanjar’s defeat in 
1141 by the forces of the Qara Khitai at 
the Qatwan steppes near Samarkand. This 
far eastern confederation of nomad tribes 
contained several Nestorian Christian ele-
ments under the rule of a mysterious nomad 
dynasty. Regardless of the legend’s origins, 
the story is popular throughout Mythic 
Europe, perhaps even popular enough to 
have drawn a troupe of powerful Faeries

The Cradle & The Crescent
settlement and pastoralists. The power of 
the original spirit is subsumed by a Faerie 
incarnation that feeds off the folktales told 
by the descendents of nomads. The towns 
along the Jaxartes border a Faerie steppe.
Mythic Mongols
The exact nature of Genghis Khan 
and his Mongol hordes is best left to in-
dividual troupes to determine, based on 
the needs of their saga and the resources 
available. The simplest approach is to treat 
the Mongols as mundane barbarians under 
a brilliantly talented mundane general and 
let history unfold as usual. Details for mun-
dane Mongol troops are given earlier. Fur-
ther details of the nomad horde’s activities 
in the Mythic Middle East in the immedi-
ate canonical future are given in Chapter 
2 of Ancient Magic, pages 15–18. The bibli-
ography in the Appendix provides further 
reading and resources available on the web 
that may aid sagas with a strong Mongol 
Mythic Mongols Story Seeds (cont’d)
styling themselves as the legions of the 
lost Christian monarch. Although posing 
as Divine agents, such creatures may best 
be presented as Faeries playing a pious 
role. They feed off the Vitality released by 
the powerful emotions created by the ef-
fect of their arrival on the Islamic Caliph-
ate, and the consequences the news of its 
devastation has on the embattled Crusad-
ers and the rest of Christian Europe.
The Vengeance of God
A final interpretation of the Mon-
gols is as a Divine host of punishment, 
although this is the most difficult to real-
ize within the historical framework. Rec-
onciling the massacres of the Transoxa-
nian towns may be problematic, but even 
within the Dominion, the manipulations 
of demons and the Infernal attempt to 
divert the righteous into temptation and 
sin. The Crusades of the Levant provide 
a precedent for the paradox of holy war. 
Of all the scenarios this may be the most 
challenging to Hermetic magi, as the 
power of the Divine is the only force 
that can trump the otherwise unassail-
able in-game position of the Order of 
Hermes as the most powerful magic in 
Mythic Europe. In a Divine horde saga, 
the Mongol shamans may be holy com-
panions following a monotheistic vision 
of the Great Tengri. Their holy powers 
are duly feared by the sahirs and hedge 
magicians of the Mythic Middle East.
The Lost Line of The Aquila
The fate of the second apprentice of 
Hercynius is unknown. His name is con-
jecture, although most tales refer to him 
simply as The Aquila. Traveling eastwards 
in search of untouched wilderness, he was 
last seen entering the littoral steppes north 
of the Crimea in the late 11th century.
On the third day of the 1228 Tribunal, 
a strange apparition appears in the Duren-
mar council chamber. The spirit material-
izes next to the startled Praeco. Witnesses 
describe seeing a translucent man carrying 
a legionary standard, a large eagle, or a 
blurred summation of both forms. Philipus 
Niger’s first attack appears to have little ef-
fect on the supposed spirit. The apparition 
merely looks around at the gathering, says 
nothing, and then quickly fades away. The 
covenant’s Aegis appears intact. The el-
derly Archivist, Xavier of Mercere, claims 
to recognize the apparition, which he says 
resembles the long-lost magus.
Is the apparition The Aquila or merely 
a shamanic descendant spirit traveling by 
phantasticum? Is there now a Nightwalker 
tradition strong enough to challenge the 
Order of Hermes, somewhere out in the 
Mythic Steppe? Could the lineage of Her-
cynius have survived? Out of Hermetic 
contact for nearly two centuries, would 
the magic of The Aquila’s descendants 
even be recognizable as Hermetic? Where 
would their allegiances lie — to the Order 
that abandoned them or to the encroach-
ing nomads of the great grass sea? What 
ramifications for the Order would ensue 
if the secret of Parma Magica has been 
handed down and shared with the hedge 
magicians of the encroaching hordes?
Steppe Spirit Story Seeds
The Ride of the Shaman
Led by visions of an unending sea of 
grass beneath the clearest of blue skies, 
one of the characters wanders out into the 
steppe alone. After surviving a harrowing 
night of severe exposure on the Steppe, 
the character successfully achieves com-
munion with the Steppe spirit and is or-
dained a shaman of the Great Tengri. 
The Ordeal inflicts an effect similar to 
a premature gain in enough Aging Points 
(in any Characteristic) to achieve the next 
level in Decrepitude, automatically forc-
ing a Crisis (see ArM5, pages 169–170), 
and the gain of enough Warping Points 
to raise his Warping score by 2. 
In return, the character gains the 
equivalent of the Nightwalker Vir-
tue, and the ability to enter ekstasis and 
generate a spirit body referred to as a 
phantasticum in return for the Pagan Flaw 
— the great spirit, while tolerant, de-
mands its messengers respect its divin-
ity (see Hedge Magic Revised Edition, pages 
103–119, for examples of Nightwalker 
traditions capable of spirit traveling). 
The Founder’s Final Work
Aloof, distant, and uncaring, the Great 
Tengri would seem to present no current 
threat to the western based Order. Unlike 
the fractured remnants of the Hercynian 
Forest Spirit, Mercurian rituals have not 
weakened this primal magical force, and 
it is yet untouched by the settlement of 
the mundane and the miracles of the Do-
minion. Its lands are largely untamed, ex-
cept at its fringes where the lesser steppe 
touches on urbanized cultures. Quiet and 
alien, it remains as powerful as ever, a vast 
reservoir of magical power waiting to be 
studied and unlocked by a Hermetic 
magus dedicated to completing the final 
work of Hercynius filius Bonisagus, the 
integration of Merinita’s original nature 
magic into Hermetic theory.

The Cradle & The Crescent
story element.
More Mythic variants based loosely in 
historical fact include casting the Mongol 
leader and even his more famous generals 
as powerful Blood of Heroes Mythic Com-
panions, as detailed in Houses of Hermes: True 
Lineages, pages 103–104. In this option, the 
Mongol leaders are scions of Ares (Mars) 
or perhaps Attila, the most famous nomad 
raider of the near past. 
Alternatively, Genghis Khan himself 
may be invested as a Spirit Votary of the 
Great Tengri spirit of the Mythic Steppe, 
having bargained with the sky spirit on the 
slopes of the sacred Mongolian mountain 
of Burkhan Khaldun (see earlier for details 
on this Kosmokrator-level Magic Spirit). 
This version of Genghis Khan may be 
able to call upon elemental Magic powers 
staggering enough to require the fractured 
Order of Hermes to unite against his cam-
paign or risk annihilation. Rules for Spirit 
Votaries are detailed in Realms of Power: 
Magic, pages 88–89. 
Magus-level Shamans?
Troupes with access to Hedge Magic 
Revised Edition may wish to consider using 
magus-level shamans in their sagas, either 
as worthy non-Hermetic adversaries or 
perhaps even as potential recruits to the 
Order via House Criamon or Ex-Miscel-
lanea. In either of the historically rooted 
scenarios detailed earlier, a powerful sha-
man might best be represented as Gifted 
Companion or Mythic Companion vari-
ants of Nightwalkers, able to travel by 
phantasticum (spirit-body), similar to 
the Magyar Taltos. Such Magic-aligned 
nomad magicians may have access to the 
Goetic Art of Summoning, the Major Vir-
tue Mythic Herbalism and perhaps some 
minor powers (Flight, Healing, Premoni-
tions, Skinchanger) commonly attributed 
to the Folk Witches found in other parts 
of Mythic Europe (see Hedge Magic Revised 
Edition, pages 33–54, for details of Folk 
Witches, and pages 103–119, for exam-
ples of Nightwalker traditions capable of 
spirit traveling).

Arabic is the most important of these, 
as the language of the Qur’an and of re-
ligion, of scholarship, and of the admin-
istration in most of the Muslim world, 
as well as the language most commonly 
spoken in the western Middle East. The 
Khaliji dialect is spoken principally in 
Arabia, whereas the Maslawi dialect is 
spoken in Iraq and Jibal. The Maghrebi 
dialect is spoken throughout North Af-
rica. The Arabic language uses the Ara-
bic script.
Parsi is also widely used, especially in 
the eastern regions, with Persian (Parsik) 
as its “court” dialect, and various distinct 
dialects for Kirman and Makran (Baloch), 
Mazandaran (Tabari), Khuzistan (Luri), 
Jibal (Kurdish), and Ghur (Pashto). The 
Sogdian dialect is spoken in most of 
Transoxiana and Khwarazm, except for 
Bactria, where they have their own dia-
lect. Parsi uses an extension of the Ara-
bic script to permit Persian sounds such 
as “p” and “ch,” although ancient texts use 
the Pahlavi script. Sogdian uses its own 
Sogdian alphabet. Avestan is the liturgical 
language of Zoroastrianism, and uses ei-
ther the older Pahlavi or the more recent 
Avestan script.
Throughout the Muslim world, vari-
ants of Oghuz are also spoken by many 
members of the nobility. Turkish is the 
dialect most commonly heard in Seljuk-
influenced areas, although the Azerbaijani 
and Ghuzz dialects of Oghuz are suffi-
ciently different from the Turkish dialect 
to cause some difficulties in understand-
ing. Historically, Oghuz was transliterated 
in Turkic “runes,” but only the Ghuzz re-
tain this tradition; Turkish is written using 
the Arabic script.
Other languages that characters 
may encounter include Hebrew (among 
Jews), Latin and Greek (especially 
among scholars), Mongolian, Aramaic 
(among some Christians of the Jazira 
and northwest provinces), Ge’ez (among 
Ethiopian Christians), Georgian, and 
Armenian. One language that is written 
and used liturgically but not commonly 
spoken is Syriac, used by Nestorian and 
Jacobite Christians. 
Muslim Names
Traditional Muslim names consist of 
some or all of a number of elements:
Ism: The name given at birth. This may 
be an Arabic name, the Qur’anic form 
of a biblical name, a compound name 
consisting of “Abd” (servant of) plus 
one of the names of God (among men; 
women might use “Amat” in place of 
“Abd,” but this is much less common), 
or a non-Arabic name.
Nasab: Pedigree. The nasab in Arabic con-
sists of “ibn” (son of) or “bint” (daugh-
ter of), followed by either the father’s 
ism or a family ism.
Kunya: This is the term “abu” (father of) or 
“umm” (mother of), prefixed to either 
the name of a child or an attribute, ac-
quired either upon becoming a parent 
or as an epithet. This may appear be-
fore the ism or after the nasab.
Laqab: An honorific or descriptive title, 
or occasionally a nickname, often 
held by nobility, religious notables 
or other important figures. Many 
laqabs consist of a compound term 
ending in “al-Din” (of the faith) or 
“al-Dawla” (of the state), while an-
other common form is to start with 
“al-Malik” (the king), followed by 
a descriptive term. Individuals may 
have more than one laqab.
Nisba: A broad term denoting profes-
sion, place of origin or birth, or tribe 
or family. It can also be a descriptive 
element. Nisbas often begin with the 
definite article “al-” and end in “i,” in 
the case of men, or “iyya,” in the case 
of women. An individual may have 
several nisbas.
As an example, the full name of Saladin 
is: Al-Malik al-Nasir Salah al-Din Abu’l-
Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub ibn Shadhi al-
Kurdi. This breaks down into:
Name: Al-Malik al-Nasir
Meaning: The King who Aids
Element: laqab

Persian Names
Muslim name structures are used by 
Persians, with a few differences. Tradi-
tional Persian isms tend replace the Arabic 
components. The nasab is indicated with 
either “i” rather than “ibn,” or else using 
the suffixes “-pur” or “-zade.” Laqabs and 
nisbas tend to follow the Muslim model, 
although often use their Parsi equivalents.
Seljuk Names
The Seljuks have adopted Muslim 
names, by and large, although traditional 
Turkic isms are used. Either “-oghlu” or “-
zade” is suffixed to the father’s or family 
name to form the nasab. Sometimes sev-
eral forbears are given.
