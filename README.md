This is a work-in-progress repository for machine-extracted, manually fixed markdowns of a complete set of the official Ars Magica Open Licensed material. These files should all be of a significantly better quality than most what has been released openly so far.

In the "done" folder you'll find any finished Markdown in tip-top shape. In the "wip" folder, you'll find versions in various states of polish (a lot is needed on many of these), and in the raw-md you'll find the RAW output dumps (via re-OCR and AI-enhanced pdf extraction) from pre-prepared, sometimes re-OCR:ed pdf files.

Note: The excellent folks at redcap.org also have a project to provide these materials to the public on their wiki. However the project seems to have slow progress as of late, and at a less complete stage than this (redcap team is welcome to grab anything here to help of course).

The public is welcome to commit new updated versions (most likely by manual edit). Make sure to provide information on what's been corrected, as well as any remaining issues. I'll accept improvements to the repository after review.
